Project PyNet is still ongoing. if you are seeing this, that means it is not public yet.
it will become public soon after no drastic changes to the organization and names are made.

sadly, i will not be accepting any contributions at this moment.

estimated date: August 2025 (uncertian + not guarenteed)
