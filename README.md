# PyNet Version 1.0.0

PyNet is an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning framework entirely built from Python.

Unlike Tensorflow or PyTorch, PyNet is intended for educational and experimental purposes, its meant to lower the barrier of entry for people intrested in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence using an easy-to-learn language while still implimenting key concepts. But because everything is entirely built on Python, training can be quite slow depending on the machine and therefore, is not advised to serve as a general-purpose library; Other, more proffesionally developed libraries may suite the task at hand.

## Contents

At its core, PyNet is a Library full of layers, activation functions, models and APIs, PyNet also has some unorthodox layers that are mainly there for experimental purposes, more information in the documentation provided.

**Built-in API**
- Synapse API
  - Multichannel Convolution
  - Dense
  - Localunit (Locally Connected Neurons)
  - AFS (Adaptive Feature Scaler) - Experimental layer
  - Maxpooling
  - Meanpooling
  - Flatten
  - Reshape
  - Operation (normalization and activation functions)
  - RecurrentBlock
  - RNN
  - LSTM
  - GRU
- MultiNet API
  - 2D Convolution
  - Dense
  - Localunit (Locally Connected Neurons)
  - AFS (Adaptive Feature Scaler) - Experimental layer
  - Maxpooling

  - RNN
  - LSTM
  - GRU

**Regressors**
- Linear Regression

- Logarithmic Regression
- Sinusoidal Regression (external model, does not follow PyNet API)

**Classifiers**
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree

  - Text is created by the author of PyNet

**Tools**

Many more featurs are present, but they are not as important as the features listed above or are internal features.

## Installation

Dependancies

## Configuration

While PyNet has an internal configuration file, it is not very extensive and is meant to provide default values to background processes, PyNet is all about transparancy and configurability per model and does not rely heavly on a central file.
