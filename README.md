### What is PyNet ‚ùì
PyNet is a free and open-source software framework for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Unlike professional-grade libraries, PyNet focuses on small-scale educational projects and experiments by providing multiple APIs and spaces for testing, experimenting, and debugging model architectures. PyNet also allows full access to the source code, lowering the barrier to entry for enthusiasts.

PyNet features distinct APIs and a suite of tools that cater to different needs that allows users to explore core ML concepts from the ground up in multiple programming paradigms. Users can directly modify and test new ideas by injecting code directly into the framework itself to allow for greater control, PyNet is client-based so modified code only affects the local file and nothing else.

PyNet is committed to democratizing and opening up machine learning and artificial intelligence to the world, so from the newest student to the most experienced scientist, we are determined to share a new technological revolution that is on the horizon.

### Getting Started üöÄ
TEXT

---

### Core Features ‚ö°
At its core, PyNet is a framework full of layers and processes that require complex setup to run properly, hence, prebuilt APIs are made in order to streamline this process. Currently, Pynet hosts four main APIs that could be used to abstract processes and make development easier and faster.

---

### Active PyNet APIs
---
#### NetFlash API
A high-performance API built around the JAX ecosystem, leveraging JNP operations and JIT-compiled systems to boost calculations up to 5x the speed thanks to the XLA compiler. Everything is designed to be modular, so a custom layer can be passed into the sequential class as long as it adheres to NetFlash specifications.

**Learnable layers:**
- Multiheaded Self-Attention
- Fully Connected
- Locally Connected
- Multichannel Convolution
- Multichannel Deconvolution
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Simple Recurrent (Recurrent)

**Functional layers:**
- Operation (Multipurpose)
- Multichannel MaxPooling
- Multichannel MeanPooling
- Flatten
- Dropout
- Reshape

#### NetLab API
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

---
#### NetCore API
The main and first API built for the PyNet framework, everything is built entirely on python with object-oriented programming as the main programming paradigm for each layer. But because everything is entirely built on Python, training can be quite slow depending on the machine and therefore, is not advised to serve as a general-purpose library; Other, more professionally developed libraries may suit the task at hand.

**Learnable layers:**
- Fully Connected
- Locally Connected
- Multichannel Convolution
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- Simple Recurrent (Recurrent)

**Functional layers:**
- Recurrent Block
- Operation (Multipurpose)
- Multichannel MaxPooling
- Multichannel MeanPooling
- Flatten
- Dropout
- Reshape

#### PyNet Alpha
The predecessor to PyNet's main APIs. This module contains basic functions for propagation, backpropagation, and updating a neural network. It's a great starting point for understanding the core mechanics before diving into the main APIs. Advanced features such as optimizers and parametric functions are not available for this implementation by default.

**Provided Methods:**
- Initialize
- Propagate
- Backpropagate
- Update
- Complimentary Training Method

### Additional Features ‚öíÔ∏è

Aside from APIs and layers, PyNet also contains other features that could aid in your project or experiment.  

---
### Regressors

PyNet's regression models provide a diverse set of tools for predicting continuous values. These models are self-contained and easy to use, making them ideal for understanding the fundamentals of curve fitting and trend analysis.

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Exponential Regression
- Power Regression
- Logarithmic Regression
- Sinusoidal Regression (external model, does not use the PyNet framework)

---
### Classifiers

The classification suite offers a range of models for predicting discrete categories. These algorithms are perfect for learning about different approaches to pattern recognition and decision-making.

- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- SVM

---
### Datasets

PyNet includes a variety of built-in datasets to get you started quickly. These datasets are pre-packaged and ready for use with the framework's models, removing the need for manual data acquisition and preprocessing.

- Cluster (classification)
- Image (variations of the MNIST dataset as a python list)
- Regression
- Text

---
### Extra Tools

The extra tools are a collection of utility modules designed to simplify common machine learning tasks. They provide functionalities for data manipulation, mathematical operations, and visualization, streamlining your workflow.

- Arraytools
- Logic
- Math
- Scaler
- Utility
- Visual
