Flash API (INDEV)
=====
  A high-level API for sequential models of neural networks, it is an optimized version of Synapse with
  drastic overhauls for speed and efficiency.
  
  simmilar to Synapse, Flash automatically handles the learning process along with hyperparameters unless specified. 
  things such as input neurons do not need to be defined and are handled automatically.

"""DEVELOPER NOTE:

leave this file empty for now, it is a placeholder for the future Flash API.
This API is currently in development and will be implemented in the future.

get synapse working and polished first, then move on to Flash.
its easier to do that first.
