chapter I

Through the desolate plains of northern France, the wind howled like a thousand wolves. I tightened my cloak, but the flimsy wool offered little protection from the piercing November chill that was clawing at my very soul. Many years spent in Gaul, particularly in this hellhole that is northern France, had made me an experienced veteran of its harsh winters. However, this one seemed... well, different. The once rich earth appeared to be crumbling beneath my very feet, transforming the soil into ashen dirt that suffocated any life that dared venture near it.
Fields that once shone in a golden hue with bundles of wheat now lay barren and desolate with skeletal stalks barely poking out from the frozen earth like bones in a forgotten battlefield. Forests that once bloomed with life stood hollow and soulless, their husks devoid of leaves and their branches wailing like fingers clawing at the dead sky. A single crow, its feathers ragged and chipped, cawed pathetic from a hollow tree, the only sound besides the wind's relentless assault. A growing unease started to brew inside my guts, one that ascended the usual pre-campaign jitters.
Back at the camp, the air filled with a different kind of tension. Gone were the days of pre-battle chants and rally cries. In their place, a simmering resentment hung heavy, thick as the smoke clinging to the damp tents, visible as ink on a white canvas. The Germanic front had been nothing but a swamp of progress for the Roman army, a bog of a land with defiant barbarians. Despite the countless hail of stones and arrows, and the countless occupations of tribes, no real provinces were ever added to the empire, just strike and go back. Much to my resentment.
Yet, the iron fist of Emperor Decius loomed overhead, a constant and unforgiving reminder that disobedience wasn't an option. Whispers of the horrors faced by the Christians of the Nile echoed in every corner, a constant, grim reminder of what defiance could bring.
As time passed and the blizzard worsened, I sat in the watchtower with nobody but the wind as company, its constant whistling interrupted by the occasional groan of decaying wood. I scanned the horizon, gazing for anything other than the relentless torrent of swirling white chaos of snow, any flicker of life, any shred of movement. Yet the desolate, lifeless plains stretched out endlessly, a sight painted in shades of gray and despair. It's all there was and all that would be.
Suddenly, a flash of crimson cut through the swirling snow, that cursed color of an imperial messenger flashing like lightning amidst the blizzard. A desperate hope flared in my chest, a degrading warmth against the unforgiving cold. Maybe it was just a patrol, a lost merchant, a stray traveler. But the hope died quickly as a lone figure slowly emerged from the blizzard, confirming the dread my insides were holding.
A messenger… rarely do they bring good news to the frontier, especially not wrapped in that cursed crimson sash. My gut twisted into a knot. Their arrival meant another campaign, another stolen dream of home, another season of life sacrificed on the endless drudgery of war. Dreams of a warm bed, a quiet village, a humble farm, it all began to slip away, replaced by the cold grip of my sword, a slab of steel destined to clash against more barbarian shields or whoever else the emperor deemed uncivilized.
"Open up the door!" I shouted, echoing off the wooden gate and into the ears of the probably napping guards inside. With cracking wood and clanking steel, the gates slowly opened, greeting the messenger to our camp.
As the only seemingly awake guard, I escorted the messenger into the throng of activity inside the camp, everybody else looking like they dozed off decades ago..
At this point in time, it's only a matter of time until we receive our new order for the day, what fresh hell awaits within the folds of that crimson sash? The weight of the unknown pressing down like a thousand boulders. Good news or bad, the sash promised change, and change in these uncertain times was a double-edged sword, a desperate hope and a chilling dread.
We strolled towards the very heart of the camp, the training field if you will, him ready to spill whatever lays inside of that scroll and me, along with the rest of the legionaries ready to listen in what mindless activity we got in store.
The once-bustling training field that brimmed with the rhythmic thud of drills and the barked commands of centurions lay desolate. Not a single soldier dared venture out onto the snow-covered expanse. Instead, men huddled in clusters, their breath puffing out in frosty clouds as they whispered about "new orders" and glances towards the messenger beside me.
Down at the harbor, a scene ripped straight from a fever dream unfolded. The once sluggish port, normally filled with the lazy rhythm of lapping waves and the occasional creaking of a ship, now buzzed with an activity so frantic it looked like a kicked hornet's nest. Towering ships, normally resembling beached whales baking in the sun, were suddenly the center of a chaotic energy. Carpenters, their hammers transformed into battering rams, pounded away at the hulls, replacing weathered planks with the fervor of possessed men. Sailors, notorious for their laid-back attitude and their uncanny ability to nap in any given situation, scurried about like ants on a sugar rush. Their usual nonchalant attitude was replaced by a frantic urgency that had them barking orders and tripping over anchor lines in equal measure.
The utter scale of the activity unfolding was a sight that would make even the most stoic centurion blink twice, a scene so bizarre, so outlandish, that it could only mean one thing - the crimson sash, the enigmatic leader who held the strings of power, was up to something truly monumental, something that would leave the entire Empire reeling in its wake.
As we arrived at the training field, the messenger took his signature trumpet and Suddenly blared out of his damned instrument, laced with a desperate urgency that shook the tents. 
Legionnaires emerged from their tents, their faces a mixture of urgency and curiosity at such rude awakenings. The messenger, ready to reveal what lies scribbled in the scroll glanced at all of us with a stoic expression carved out of granite.
He yelled, "Soldiers of Rome, Prepare for departure! We set sail at dawn!" with a stern, authoritative tone. "The Emperor, in his infinite wisdom, has decreed a new expedition - westward!"
A tense silence filled the ranks, followed by a wave of laughter that swept over the crowd within the drop of a hat. west? Beyond the endless horizon of the sea?.
"West?" A voice scoffed, the voice laden with disbelief. "What madness is this? Have the barbarians breached the Rhine river and we must flee across the sunset?"
A ripple of nervous laughter spread through the ranks. "Westward expeditions were the stuff of drunken tavern tales, not imperial edicts!" another scoffed, the whole camp erupting into a frenzy of laughter, piercing through the walls and into the lifeless wastes around the camp.
"This mission is of the utmost importance! Persians of the east had proved troublesome for our mission to Sinae, secure vital resources for the future of our glorious empire!" he interrupted, I could already sense the frustration in the tone, though, none even bother listening for a single word to begin with.
"Vital resources!?" A young legionnaire spat on the ground, it was Aulus, a man notoriously nonchalant, now suddenly erupted in a torrent of discontentment. "What resources could possibly be worth venturing beyond the horizon of the known world!?"
Then, another roared at the messenger. "19,000 miles of pure ocean with nothing but water!? We'll be lucky if we even see a single island!"
The messenger's attitude towards their announcement had probably fueled the legionaries' barrage of mocking insults towards the messenger, who now stood helpless against the brewing storm that is an angered crowd.
Yet, the messenger continued to drone on about the "earth-shattering significance" of this mission. His words bounced off the crowd like pebbles against a fortress wall, doing little to dent the growing tension that's just waiting to erupt. Each word that escaped his lips felt hollower than a helmet. Where was the sense of purpose? The nobility of sacrifice? This whole expedition reeked of a drunken tavern tale, not a glorious conquest! A "what-if" scenario disguised as a heroic odyssey, a gamble disguised as a noble quest. Sure, the whole legion's collective intelligence might be duller than a wooden sword, but at least we spoke perfect latin, we were still people.
The messenger might as well have sung nursery rhymes for all the impact the words had. The legionnaires, burned-out, tired and discontent, weren't buying it a single word. Eyes deepened, fists clenched tighter and a low rumble began to brew through the crowd, a storm right beneath the surface.
Amidst the blabbering the messenger droned on and on forever, a sudden, yet powerful line striked at my very soul.
"The First Cohort of Legion XII have been chosen for this heroic expedition," the messenger boomed, his voice crackling with forced authority, "they will depart in a few moments. Everyone else prepare the ships and part goodbyes to your fellow comrades."
A collective gasp jolted through the crowd. That's… my cohort, We were battered, weary and barely fit for another campaign in the frozen north, let alone a voyage into the unknown. We weren't the strongest, the fastest or the newest recruits. The once-mocking crowd, their laughter now a chilling memory, erupted. Shouts and curses filled the air with those lucky enough to not be chosen giving us their helpless glances to their doomed comrades.
The messenger's empty reassurances rang hollow. Why the westward expedition? If there WERE new lands to conquer, wouldn't they be closer? Something more guaranteed to boost support, morale and fill the depleted coffers? Even better, why us? Why burned-out troops, when younger, more energetic troops sounded more appealing? Hell, why send legionnaires when auxiliary reserves are usually first pick? Where did they go!? This wasn't about glory or conquest, the senate went mad!

chapter II

Regardless, the legionnaires dispersed, flocking to their tents to pack up everything, even the tent itself. While the lucky ones disappear to gods know where, ready to finally fill the would-be desolate camp that had stood waiting for them.
Back at my tent, pandemonium reigned. Even the notoriously lazy Aulus, a man who could nap through a barbarian war horn were suddenly infused with jittery energy like ants on a sugar rush, i grabbed whatever i had laid on my sleeping bag, some few utensils here and there and a bottle of whatever i put last night and stuffed everything, even the sleeping bag into my backpack.
By the time I emerged, blinking in the sun, the camp had become a scene straight out of an artist's nightmare. Tents lay crumpled and defeated, victims of rushing legionnaires with a rope and a grudge. From inside the deflated canvas, a chorus of curses erupted, a book of colorful vocabulary dedicated to whoever, intentionally or otherwise, had trapped them in their temporary home.
"Really!? We're still packing up! Have some patience for once…" Aulus shouted, his muffled voice barely audible through the tent walls
After a comedic dance of flailing limbs and plenty of facepalms, the unfortunate souls finally wriggled free, their faces a perfect study in bewilderment. The remaining tents were then wrestled to the ground, rolled-up with surprising efficiency and hoisted by these newly energized warriors. As the sun, a fiery orange ball sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows across the choppy waves, I watched as the weary legionaries packed-up whatever they got in their tent and boarded their assigned vessels. 
The initial shock of the announcement had begun to morph into a deep, simmering resentment. Hushed conversations, laced with paranoia and suspicion, sprouted like weeds between the men. What was this westward expedition truly about? Where were they sailing? These were not the usual pre-battle boasts or promises of glorious spoils. Instead, fearful and resentful goodbyes that reigned over the minds of many. Men gave their final handshakes. It was the fear in the final goodbye, a desolate acceptance that they might never see home ever again in this one-way ticket to a fate shrouded in mystery.
Days bled into weeks. The vast expanse of the ocean stretched before us, an endless blue canvas dotted with the occasional flash of sunlight on a distant wave. Isolation settled like a fog, broken only by the creaking of the ships and the cries of seagulls circling overhead. 
"Marcus, are those clouds in the distance?" Aulus trembled "incoming storm!" he cried, pointing to a dark patch of clouds.
"Just a squall, even then the sailors got our backs with their years of sailing" I interjected, Aulus's face though, remains unchanging.
"No no no, those ARE storms! We should turn around and go back!" he interrupted, this time his face filled with urgency, a senseless one at best.
"Turn around!? You're making a commotion here! Back to your post Aulus!" I barked, annoyed and slightly embarrassed by Aulus's paranoia. It's as if he switched from a nonchalant child to a paranoid elder within a day.
The sea slowly grew unstable and unstable, first it was the ever increasing height of crashing waves, then it grew windier and windier, then a light drizzle followed by a sudden slam of rain, heavy rain.
with every second the waves got ever so aggressive. Everyone huddled inside the cabins. A tremor of unease snaked through the crew. In the distance, the once-clear horizon began to curdle, dark clouds engulfing us like an angry bruise on the deep-blue sky. The playful wind, which had teased the sails mere moments earlier, now growled with a menacing undercurrent.
As the playful dance slowly turned into a violent struggle, the storm hit with the suddenness of a wolf's pounce. Neptune, mighty lord of the sea unleashed his mighty fury upon us with one snap of a finger. 
Divine winds howled like tortured souls, testing the timbers of ships and the sanity of men. Rain lashed down like a thousand icy needles, each drop a stinging feel through armor thick and thin, only the lower decks promised refuge within.
Mountainous waves, like ravenous giants, awakened from their slumber, reaching for the sky and aiming down at the fragile lumber, bashing down with all its might, relentlessly with no end in sight. the ship's bow, the toughest part of the vessel crumbles at the first blow. Every creak, every shuddering crash and every groaning timber made the already precarious situation grimmer. Every agonizing second, the threat of capsizing loomed larger with each blow growing harder. Each passing moment, the waves slowly turned into everyman's opponent.
Everyone huddled around tables sharing oh so many stories and fables, battling Neptune's wrath together, the swinging cabin a reminder of the outside's stormy weather. From legionairy to centurion, they all ponder the same obscure question.
Why were they picked? Everyone grew increasingly sick by a question that still remains a mystery, day and night the odyssey had brought nothing but misery. Booze and wine helped a little, though our existence remains brittle.
Through the deafening roar, a new primal question had made its way into the hearts of every man on board. Would they find salvation on some unknown shore? or would this expanse of water swing its sword, leading us to a world where Hades is our lord?
The storm rages on, offering no answer but the relentless assault on our bodies and spirits, every second a painful countdown to death's visit. Its grasp on us clearly has no limit so all we could do is pray the sea doesn't stay wicked.

Chapter III

Seven sunless days bled into nights, each indistinguishable from the other in the harsh and relentless grip of the storm's might. Neptune, the ferocious god of the sea seemed to take pleasure in toying with our fragile existence with storms of unspeakable power, relentlessly assaulting our sanity into powder.
Exhaustion lies at our very core. Sleep, the gateway to the land of dreams, now remained locked-up within its very own doors, stolen countless times in moments between the crashing waves and the howling wind. Hope, once a flickering lamp that had cast a warm glow in the darkest hours had dwindled to a pile of ash, long dead.
Then, silence. The storm, exhausted from its tantrum, began to simmer down. The waves, though still grumpy, grumbled their complaints in a defeated rumble, their relentless pounding replaced by a sullen roll. The ships, looking like they'd just been mauled by a kraken, groaned with every shift of the sea. The once-proud hulls were now a patchwork of scars and splinters, a testament to Neptune's mood. The chaos of the storm had given way to an eerie stillness, pressing down with the weight of a mountain on our chests. A stark reminder of the hell we'd just endured.
Stepping out of the prison that is the lower-decks, we were greeted by a scene of utter devastation. The deck was a battlefield littered with splintered dreams and broken beams, creating obstacles worthy of the Minotaur himself. Everybody surveyed the wreckage with a mix of dark humor and sheer terror. Masts, once soaring like proud deities, now lay fallen across the deck like giants. Sails, once billowing with the wind, hung in shredded tatters, clinging on for dear life by threads. Floorboards gaped like canyons, the churning depths just a heartbeat below.
"Gosh, it's like the fists of Neptune fell down on us…" Aulus mumbled, "one storm could do this much damage, just one."
The very bones of the ship lay exposed, weeping tears at the memory of the storm's fury. Yet, amidst the scene, defiance still finds a way to remain. These vessels were battered, not broken. They refused to yield their final breath to the sea. With all our sweat and grit, we would mend their wounds, bring life back to their broken bodies, and continue our westward odyssey. It was either that, or become permanent residents of this dungeon. No pressure.
By now, the silence of the sea, usually a welcome relief, felt especially oppressive. Occasionally broken by shouts and hollers from other ships, the rest of the crew finally released from their barely-dry prisons below deck, letting loose the emotions they'd been forced to bottle up for the past weeks or so. Gone were the days of the storm's roaring symphony of destruction. Now, an eerie peace had taken over
One by one, the sailors had slowly started to patch-up gaping holes in the hull, a tangled web of ropes, pulleys, and levers hummed with renewed purpose as the crew replaced splintered masts and nailed down wherever broken. The once hopeless faces of the sailors now glowed with a newfound determination. The once messy decks, a battlefield of timber, were slowly being transformed. We would stitch up the wounds of our vessel and recuperate from the ordeal, but a disquieting quiet had settled over regardless
The sheer monotony of despair began to slowly introduce itself to the crew. Sailors by the handful, turned their heads skyward, searching, yearning for anything remotely interesting. Seagulls soaring overhead, particularly spectacular clouds, unusually dark patches of sky, anything to break the solid slab of blue all around us. Even a speck of dust on the horizon would have been a welcome distraction..
Suddenly, a figure clambered down from the crow's nest, a silhouette against the sky. A descent full of blurs of flailing limbs and frantic shouts, the deck suddenly flared, the once calm air now a hotbed of murmurs amidst the gentle waves, as everyone gathered around the scout, a great wall of shoulders muffled every word into a incoherent murmur as any shouting voices rebounded off the crowd, the ever fainter voice, unintelligible, managed to roar with a single word that managed to dash through the howling wind.
"Land!"
Like a spark igniting a sleeping phoenix, disbelief gave way to a gasp, eyes, bloodshot and weary, strained towards the horizon, searching for any sign, any confirmation of this impossible salvation. The vast expanse of blue was all there was, mocking us in our face with the cruel promise of more water. 
"Land?" a voice spat, spitting a stream of tobacco juice overboard. "What's next? Mermaids singing shanties? Keep dreamin', lads, and get back to work. We've got a ship to mend, not fantasies to chase."
Everybody exchanged uneasy glances, it was like a brutal jab of reason and logic, leagues stronger and convincing than anything hope could ever achieve, sapping away every second as I breathed. 
Regardless, everybody slowly continued tending the weeping ships, repairing broken floorboards, hammering splintered masts, sewing sails back and sweeping debris off the ship, an aura of disturbance crossed everyone's faces, trying to forget about such promises and move on, yet the possibility of salvation still clung by the skin of the teeth on our minds. Still, pessimism reigns, infecting the minds of many.
But as if a thousand ears were with us, a lookout from another ship in the distance cried the same hooplah, his voice echoing across the waves. Then, a murmur. A single word, barely audible, yet laced with a tremor of disbelief. 
"land?" 
Many simply dismissed it as another illusion played by the mind after weeks spent indoors. Though many strained their eyes again, this time confirming with a jolt of excitement, more and more doubters cave-in, gazing towards the horizon for any sign of land. Just like that, pessimism shattered into a thousand shards.
There, on the edge of the world, a speck, A smudge, barely visible against the endless white and blue. But there it was. From desperate wishes to tangible reality, lies salvation.
The crew then erupted into a collective cheer, shattering the silence, and replacing it with a mix of yells and hollers, a testament to the crew's renewed spirit. Land. Salvation. A new beginning across the waves, a beacon of hope that promised an end to our harrowing journey.
The fleet, a battered collection of vessels slowly lurched closer to the jewel on the horizon. A stark contrast to the despair that had gripped us a week ago, the promise of new lands ignited a fire within.
The closer we came, the more the alien world seemed to be, towering the trees, their forms fantastical and alien, scratching at the sky with their dense canopy and golden beaches shining like gold dust amidst the emerald backdrop.
The churning waters gave way to a calm bay as the fleet finally halted, anchoring roughly a quarter-mile away from the shore. Chaos erupted as the legionnaires clambered down and supplies ferried onto dingy rafts and leaky canoes cobbled together from the wreckage. The centurion's commands felt hollow amidst the chaos, much to their frustration.
I threw myself into the water and joined in the chaos. The splash of salty lukewarm water brings a jolt of refreshment from the week spent cooped-up in the cramped cabins. I grabbed a splintered mast paddled along with the crowd with cautious optimism blooming within.
As we set foot on the shores of this uncharted world, the soft sand was a stark contrast against the hard wooden decks. Free from the terrors of the sea. Yet, the euphoria was short-lived as barked orders shattered the calm,
"Hurry up! Grab those bags and march along, we're going for a river a mile that way!"
Around me, everyone marched towards the interior, aiming for a supposedly glistering ribbon of water a mile away. My muscles, still stiff from the cramped journey, fell in step at the back of the column. The vibrant, almost unnatural green that blanketed the land felt unsettlingly foreign with sunlight filtering through the dense canopy, leaving behind an eerie glow on the twisted trees unlike anything ever encountered back in Europe.
A sudden roar then shattered the chirping symphony of birds. The legionnaires froze, heads swiveling about, scanning the foliage for the source of the sound. Uncertain murmurs rippled through the ranks. Was it a beast? A demon? Their unease deepened, "Dragons, no doubt," Aulus spat "Just like the stories of old."
I scoffed internally. Dragons? Here? Yet, the sound echoed through the trees unlike any animal call I'd ever heard before, whatever it may be, it's nothing to play around with, lurking deep within these lands, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. 
As the march resumed, the hushed conversations followed suit. The unfamiliarity of this new world, once a source of wonder, now casts a shadow of unease. Regardless, We pressed on, each step the faint sound of water slowly grew as we lurk closer to this ever so familiar sound of salvation.
Emerging from the thick forest and onto a small clearing, the sudden expanse of sunlight blinding as ever after quite some time in the thick jungle. After our eyes adjusted to the sunlight, we saw it. There lies a glistening stream, a lifeblood to any army flowing freely in abundance. 
As more and more people swarmed the small stream, the more chaotic the scene went, from men kneeling down and drinking to their heart's content to some even plunging into the icy water. Yet before we could truly rest, a sudden voice boomed through the ecstatic cheers,
"Listen up!" the voice jolted through the ranks, swiveling heads to the unmarked man. "Provisions had dwindled faster than anticipated, even though the soil promised future feasts, hunger wouldn't be satisfied by unplanted seeds"
The initial euphoria vaporized, giving way to a harsh realization of the true situation we're all in. Slowly but surely, everyone got their act together and finally acted like grown adults.
"We're splitting the cohort into centuries, 6 in total, each would venture out to establish a minor fort within reach of each other."
Just like that, without question, formations slowly emerged, the once chaotic whirlwind transformed into a well-oiled machine. Polished armor glinted in the sun, swords and javelins were checked, supplies readied and faces hardened with a mixture of excitement and nervousness. The unknown waited just beyond the trees afterall.
Amidst the torrent of activity, I found myself thrusted into my century, an unidentifiable crowd of people, commanded by a centurion named Titus, a man whose weathered face tells stories of countless battles. He would lead our century and guide us through the jungle to a destination only him and the higher-ups know. With one order, the century pushed into the jungle.
The unpaved path proved troubling to the men, we didn't bother bringing along any donkeys or pack-animals so some unfortunate souls got the finger and hauled extras. Tripping and stumbling about on our trek, and as much as everybody else enjoyed laughing at people stumbling about, the monotonous march didn't discriminate, proven by the sudden grunt of men tripping over massive roots and what not, our feet accustomed to the flat and hilly terrain of Europe.
"Whoa, watch out there buddy, almost fall face-flat" Aulus remarked, vaguely pointing at me after I almost, well, fell face-first. The land really didn't discriminate against who to choose to trip-over.
Each passing step of the trek, the land morphed and twists with no possible end in sight. Plants and flowers slowly morphed and defied description, their impossible shapes and colors an clear sign that demons had tinkered the very essence of nature itself. The once familiar chirping of birds slowly morphed into distant roars of unseen beasts and the unsettling cries of creatures we couldn't even begin to imagine. The calls of exotic animals begged we landed in a new plane of reality yet the constellations of heavenly lamps proved otherwise. 
Exhaustion finally forced a halt after what felt like an eternity of marching. We emerged into a clearing, a welcome break from the oppressive canopy.
"We have arrived!" Titus's voice boomed, cutting through the hushed whispers. "A fort near the stream would be ideal. This time, double-reinforce the walls with whatever. There be dragons!"
Dragons? I scoffed, regardless, the men dropped their bags and I soon joined the whirlwind of activities unfolding. Some soldiers went straight to assembling tents in neat rows while others tackled the vital task of building the fortifications. Walls rose from the ground, hastily constructed but reinforced with every available scrap of wood. Others, wielding axes and saws, hatched and pounded away against the towering trees, bringing down towering giants with trunks that could build entire fleets.
"Aye Marcus, are you gonna do something this time? Promise me you won't 'accidentally' sleep while on construction duty" Aulus commented, interrupting my nail-hammering session.
"You? Really? Oh, don't. I remember that one time you—" but before I could complete my retort, Aulus shushed me, interrupting me once again.
"Whoa whoa relax! Don't need to bring that up!" Aulus blurted, he knew with full certainty that what I'd about to say was probably something Aulus wants to keep behind closed doors, not like Aulus assassinated the emperor or anything, it's just funny, well, in my eyes.
Hours bled into one another, interrupted by rhythmic hammering of nails and the groans of hauling logs. It was a period of monotonous labor, broken only by the occasional panicked report of striped, masked creatures snatching away saws and canteens, quite the oddity.
As dusk settled, Titus called pause for the day. The above-average fortification was deemed "insufficient" by Titus and others, frustrating most of the men who had spent sweat and more sweat to please them to only be met with a dismissive shrug, but beneath the deep sighs and murmurs, everybody understood the rationale. Whatever lurked beyond the walls could turn our defenses to splinters in a heartbeat.
Titus, sensing the exhaustion in the troops and in a rare show of empathy, approved a century-wide communal dinner. A central fire crackled to life, fueled by volunteers feeding scraps and twigs into the inferno, others began to cook whatever remained of the unit's rations and the meager offerings foraged by the ever-resourceful farmers. Everyone gathered around the fire, cracking jokes and sharing stories to brighten-up the otherwise gloomy mood. Titus emerged from his fancy tent and offered his obligatory praises for today's hard work, along with the usual generic lines meant to boost morale.
But one announcement stuck out like a sore thumb, "Scouts," Titus declared, his voice grave, "reported sightings of smoke plumes, likely from settlements of native origins. Tomorrow, a scouting party of twenty-five along with goods will be dispatched to make first contact."
A wave of mixed emotions washed over the century. Some, including Aulus scoffed at the idea, questioning the existence of human life far far away from the known world. Others, fueled by desperation, saw potential allies in this foreign land. While some chose to ignore the declaration and chowed-down on some freshly-baked bread. A sliver of unease lingered regardless. Who were these natives? Friends or foes? Human or beast? The answer, like everything else in this new world, remained shrouded in mystery.

Chapter IV

The first rays of dawn filtered through the dense canopy, casting long shadows across the tent, reminding us of today's exciting schedule of construction, construction and even more construction or if i'm lucky, scavenging. 
Though the repetitive act of reinforcing walls and digging mounds felt as enticing as gold compared to what may lay in the jungles, hunter or hunted.
A quick meal of hardbread shared among my tent got the men talking with the usual chatter of slander, stale jokes and rumors between us, a what would be regular routine slowly morphed into a sense of brotherhood as this drop of predictability lightened the mood against the blizzard of uncertainty reigning in this new world.
Emerging from the tent, we were greeted by the sight of Titus inspecting tents with a band of men following in his every footsteps. Titus, ever glued to his documents, moved tent-by-tent, picking up anyone he saw fit along the way.
After a great deal of disappointed faces, Titus finally arrived at our tent, ordering us to line-up shoulder to shoulder. He then proceeded to scrutinize and analyze each and every single face with a deep gaze to the soul and a soul-crushing insult.
"Marcus!" he boomed, his voice gravelly with exhaustion, jolting my half-asleep brain wide awake "No offense, but you're quite literally the most average person i've got, You're coming along!"
Dread shot through. Out of the hundred men in our century, he somehow thought I would be perfect to dive head-first into those damned jungles, for god's sake I've seen absolute beasts in our century, yet, me.
"Yes sir!" I answered, followed by a resolute nod as I joined the ranks, as if I had a choice to begin with. An average joe like me would be first-pick for what lies beneath the foliage, a great way to start my morning.
After grabbing both my shield and sword, the absolute bare-minimum for any exploration, the group instantly went-off to walk towards the currently flimsy gates of the camp, with Titus speaking loudly about all-sorts of things, but out of all the things he droned on and on about, one stood out.
"Ever notice how the other centuries suddenly grew quiet despite the relatively close distance?" he asks, a tense silence followed before somebody shattered the silence with a plausible answer.
"probably making their own expeditions into the unknown with their own motives". Unsatisfied, Titus simply shrugged the answer, possibly out of desperation to seek out more rations for all of us, this time with an oddly peaceful manner.
Saying our final goodbyes to the century, we dived head-first into the dense jungle, Trekking through foliage thick and thin, seemingly holding a million watchful eyes. Stories of encounters with wild creatures started to cloud my mind, fueling the already horrible storm of paranoia deep within me, although such stories were a dime a dozen with their credibility being shaky at best, their sheer plausibility and numbers dwarf any shred of logic and reasoning.
After what felt like ages trekking, rising right through the dense canopy, a barely visible, but noticeable plume of smoke was taking shape in the distance, its thin, yet familiar silhouette hinted of a groundbreaking discovery just within reach.
"Anyone else saw that?" a soldier commented "might be lost comrades, Perhaps another of our forts?" another muttered, dismissing these comments, Titus ordered us to raise our shields and stay alert for any hint of movement in the foliage while keeping-pace with the seemingly fearless Titus.
As we approach the plume of smoke, its silhouette growing larger with each pace, a flicker of movement in the dense undergrowth caught our eyes with hands instinctively reaching for the javelin, the marching immediately halted with heads swiveling about, scanning for any sign of life, peaceful or otherwise within the cluttered forest with each tree, each bush, each blade of grass scanned, a new one rattled in movement, begging to catch our ears and eyes.
Amidst the chaos, a lone figure emerged roughly 50 paces in front of us, though not of any human. The figure possessed dark-brown skin reminiscent of the distant persians and ethiopians while its head grew white feathers by the dozens, sweeping back like the spikes of a porcupine with a terrifying, yet majestic look, its ears grew long strands of hair in a mix of black and white reaching all the way to the chest, all clothed in a gray half-tunic with occasional stripes of exotic colors normally reserved for the wealthy.
The entity, for their part, mirrored our surprise and summoned a handful more from the foliage, raising their spears and clubs at us while shouting incoherent grunts that were as intelligible as the chirping of birds in their brutish tongue. Yet amidst the back-and-forth between us and these mysterious beings, Titus, ever the pragmatist, stepped forward with his hand outstretched in a gesture of peace. 
After a tense moment, one by one, they lowered their weapons with one of them hesitantly mirroring Titus's gesture. Slowly, we approached with cautious steps as we flashed our shining arrowheads at these beings, stopping at an arm's length before the pragmatist Titus reached his hand once again in an offer to shake hands, the barbarians looked at each other in a cautious manner before one inevitably shook Titus's hand with a firm nod. First contact.
Communication was a frustrating dance of charades and gestures. Grunts and pointing became a common makeshift language and despite my best efforts to bridge the vast cultural divide, every word failed us. Though, amidst the confusion. An elder of immeasurable age offered a woven basket filled with strange, dark-crimson fruits reminiscent of Italian cherries the size of a fist. Beside it, a handful of massive orange-ish oblong fruits reminiscent of apricots, its shape holding promises of new and unknown flavors undiscovered yet up to this point.
In return, we hesitantly offered our metal trinkets and gleaming iron arrowheads, A tense moment soon followed with our eyes locked in a silent exchange. 
Then, a smile broke out across the elder's face, crinkling the corners of her eyes while reaching out, accepting the offer, and in turn, placing the baskets and plenty of fruits in everybody's palm. Well, except Titus, his stoic demeanor might just seem mean or disrespectful. Regardless, a successful trade had been made, a fragile peace treaty forged through the clinking of metal and the soft thud of fruit on the forest floor.
This encounter held the promise of something even more. This milestone, this first contact, this trade deal, would be big news back at the fort. And with a sudden surge of hope, Titus ordered us to return immediately, dismissing the fact that everybody's hands were brimming with oversized exotic fruits and baskets, enough to feed the entire settlement for a few but precious days.
The journey back was especially exhausting, considering the weight of massively oversized fruits. Nonetheless, As we emerged from the dense foliage, we were greeted by a scene of concerned guards rushing towards us, swords fully drawn and bracing the worst of news. 
Titus' frantic dash through the woods must've spelled bloodshed and pillaging in bold with the rest of us stumbling out behind, panting from the sheer weight of the fruits barely balancing in our arms.
Titus, ever the leader, bolted past the bewildered guards and straight inside. While he disappeared to Jupiter knows where, the guards approached us for an answer to the contextless scene.
"Is anyone injured!? Are you guys on the run!?" one of the guards shouted, his voice dashing through the air like a bolt of lightning.
"No no no we're fine, Titus was just a tad excited about a successful trade…" one man muttered, pausing to adjust the towering mountain of fruits between his arms
"There's a lot to unpack, just help us unload these things and im sure Titus will clear things up for ya"
The guards looked at eachother with bewilderment despite the obvious answer, though, completely understandable considering that a calm and stern Titus is all they ever knew and him breaking out of the woods full-speed probably caught them off-guard.
As we unloaded the massive fruits into crates, Titus ordered a century-wide meeting to listen to his story but instead of the hundreds gathering like last night, a motley group of men are willing to listen with most seemingly disinterested. Regardless, Titus roared in excitement with his voice booming through the air, flaring in a collective jolt of enthusiasm within the century, eyes wide with wonder at the alien goods we were tirelessly sorting out.
"Are those things even real?" one voice asked, it was Aulus of course, that ever so familiar voice indented in my brain.
"What do you think? Of course Aulus!" I answered, doing little to satisfy Aulus's awe and wonder.
Just as Titus, energized by the success, began sending out news and formulating plans for another trade mission, a messenger materialized from the throng of legionnaires, dashing full-speed towards us with a face stricken with urgency. 
Upon reaching us, the young man, face pale and panting from the marathon through the woods. Gasped silent words towards the amused Titus, midway through his monologue of plans.
"WHAT!?" Titus boomed, his immeasurable rage jolting all of us, pointing the whole camp's eyes and ears towards him and the messenger.
"Fort Aquila… attacked…" he continued, his face and voice reeking disbelief and disappointment, the messenger for his part, continued whispering silent words that hung heavy amidst this tension
"Plundering baskets of grain from villages, now the fort's hanging by a thread!". Those are the last words the messenger voiced, now in a desperate plea instead of the secrecy they usually spoke in.
Disbelief morphed into fury that settled throughout the camp. Stealing from potential allies? The sheer stupidity of some men never ceased to amaze even the gods. This singular act of greed had poisoned the well of trust we just dug so painstakingly with the natives. 
Titus, in his silent rage, stared at the messenger deep to the soul with a disappointed gaze louder than any shouted curse could achieve.
"It's been days and we already had made a reputation for ourselves" Titus sighed, "We'll send aid to the fort along with some reinforcements…" The messenger, barely out of his teens, simply nodded, not uttering a single word.
Titus understood the logic behind the raids, desperate men facing starvation would resort to desperate measures. But that understanding did little to snuff the rising tide of fury. Here, in this uncharted territory, the old ways burrowed its way back into the minds of many. 
As the days wore on, more and more frantic scouts and messengers barged-in to our century, reporting on ambushes and assaults in far-off forts with each new report ever more brutality than the last. Despite our century being untouched by any of the violence, we still bore the brunt of the ever escalating tension nonetheless. The natives, once curious observers, now cast wary glances our way with the once-vibrant trading sessions slowly devolving into tense standoffs with neither side uttering a single thing.
Titus, initially dismissive of the ever-growing tensions grew increasingly hesitant by the day to venture out into the unknown, even though it was our only source of sustenance within these estranged lands. Even with the fiercest warriors by his side, paranoia had filled the bravest of men, now all we could do was watch as our lifeline was slowly eroding along with any last shred of hope..
At this point, it's not a matter of "if" but "when." When would the fragile truce finally snap, plunging them all into a bloody conflict with no possible end in sight?
I knew with a chilling certainty that the answer wouldn't be long in coming.

Through the desolate plains of northern France, the wind howled like a thousand wolves. I tightened my cloak, but the flimsy wool offered little protection from the piercing November chill that was clawing at my very soul. Many years spent in Gaul, particularly in this hellhole that is northern France, had made me an experienced veteran of its harsh winters. However, this one seemed... well, different. The once rich earth appeared to be crumbling beneath my very feet, transforming the soil into ashen dirt that suffocated any life that dared venture near it.
Fields that once shone in a golden hue with bundles of wheat now lay barren and desolate with skeletal stalks barely poking out from the frozen earth like bones in a forgotten battlefield. Forests that once bloomed with life stood hollow and soulless, their husks devoid of leaves and their branches wailing like fingers clawing at the dead sky. A single crow, its feathers ragged and chipped, cawed pathetic from a hollow tree, the only sound besides the wind's relentless assault. A growing unease started to brew inside my guts, one that ascended the usual pre-campaign jitters.
Back at the camp, the air filled with a different kind of tension. Gone were the days of pre-battle chants and rally cries. In their place, a simmering resentment hung heavy, thick as the smoke clinging to the damp tents, visible as ink on a white canvas. The Germanic front had been nothing but a swamp of progress for the Roman army, a bog of a land with defiant barbarians. Despite the countless hail of stones and arrows, and the countless occupations of tribes, no real provinces were ever added to the empire, just strike and go back. Much to my resentment.
Yet, the iron fist of Emperor Decius loomed overhead, a constant and unforgiving reminder that disobedience wasn't an option. Whispers of the horrors faced by the Christians of the Nile echoed in every corner, a constant, grim reminder of what defiance could bring.
As time passed and the blizzard worsened, I sat in the watchtower with nobody but the wind as company, its constant whistling interrupted by the occasional groan of decaying wood. I scanned the horizon, gazing for anything other than the relentless torrent of swirling white chaos of snow, any flicker of life, any shred of movement. Yet the desolate, lifeless plains stretched out endlessly, a sight painted in shades of gray and despair. It's all there was and all that would be.
Suddenly, a flash of crimson cut through the swirling snow, that cursed color of an imperial messenger flashing like lightning amidst the blizzard. A desperate hope flared in my chest, a degrading warmth against the unforgiving cold. Maybe it was just a patrol, a lost merchant, a stray traveler. But the hope died quickly as a lone figure slowly emerged from the blizzard, confirming the dread my insides were holding.
A messenger… rarely do they bring good news to the frontier, especially not wrapped in that cursed crimson sash. My gut twisted into a knot. Their arrival meant another campaign, another stolen dream of home, another season of life sacrificed on the endless drudgery of war. Dreams of a warm bed, a quiet village, a humble farm, it all began to slip away, replaced by the cold grip of my sword, a slab of steel destined to clash against more barbarian shields or whoever else the emperor deemed uncivilized.
"Open up the door!" I shouted, echoing off the wooden gate and into the ears of the probably napping guards inside. With cracking wood and clanking steel, the gates slowly opened, greeting the messenger to our camp.
As the only seemingly awake guard, I escorted the messenger into the throng of activity inside the camp, everybody else looking like they dozed off decades ago..
At this point in time, it's only a matter of time until we receive our new order for the day, what fresh hell awaits within the folds of that crimson sash? The weight of the unknown pressing down like a thousand boulders. Good news or bad, the sash promised change, and change in these uncertain times was a double-edged sword, a desperate hope and a chilling dread.
We strolled towards the very heart of the camp, the training field if you will, him ready to spill whatever lays inside of that scroll and me, along with the rest of the legionaries ready to listen in what mindless activity we got in store.
The once-bustling training field that brimmed with the rhythmic thud of drills and the barked commands of centurions lay desolate. Not a single soldier dared venture out onto the snow-covered expanse. Instead, men huddled in clusters, their breath puffing out in frosty clouds as they whispered about "new orders" and glances towards the messenger beside me.
Down at the harbor, a scene ripped straight from a fever dream unfolded. The once sluggish port, normally filled with the lazy rhythm of lapping waves and the occasional creaking of a ship, now buzzed with an activity so frantic it looked like a kicked hornet's nest. Towering ships, normally resembling beached whales baking in the sun, were suddenly the center of a chaotic energy. Carpenters, their hammers transformed into battering rams, pounded away at the hulls, replacing weathered planks with the fervor of possessed men. Sailors, notorious for their laid-back attitude and their uncanny ability to nap in any given situation, scurried about like ants on a sugar rush. Their usual nonchalant attitude was replaced by a frantic urgency that had them barking orders and tripping over anchor lines in equal measure.
The utter scale of the activity unfolding was a sight that would make even the most stoic centurion blink twice, a scene so bizarre, so outlandish, that it could only mean one thing - the crimson sash, the enigmatic leader who held the strings of power, was up to something truly monumental, something that would leave the entire Empire reeling in its wake.
As we arrived at the training field, the messenger took his signature trumpet and Suddenly blared out of his damned instrument, laced with a desperate urgency that shook the tents. 
Legionnaires emerged from their tents, their faces a mixture of urgency and curiosity at such rude awakenings. The messenger, ready to reveal what lies scribbled in the scroll glanced at all of us with a stoic expression carved out of granite.
He yelled, "Soldiers of Rome, Prepare for departure! We set sail at dawn!" with a stern, authoritative tone. "The Emperor, in his infinite wisdom, has decreed a new expedition - westward!"
A tense silence filled the ranks, followed by a wave of laughter that swept over the crowd within the drop of a hat. west? Beyond the endless horizon of the sea?.
"West?" A voice scoffed, the voice laden with disbelief. "What madness is this? Have the barbarians breached the Rhine river and we must flee across the sunset?"
A ripple of nervous laughter spread through the ranks. "Westward expeditions were the stuff of drunken tavern tales, not imperial edicts!" another scoffed, the whole camp erupting into a frenzy of laughter, piercing through the walls and into the lifeless wastes around the camp.
"This mission is of the utmost importance! Persians of the east had proved troublesome for our mission to Sinae, secure vital resources for the future of our glorious empire!" he interrupted, I could already sense the frustration in the tone, though, none even bother listening for a single word to begin with.
"Vital resources!?" A young legionnaire spat on the ground, it was Aulus, a man notoriously nonchalant, now suddenly erupted in a torrent of discontentment. "What resources could possibly be worth venturing beyond the horizon of the known world!?"
Then, another roared at the messenger. "19,000 miles of pure ocean with nothing but water!? We'll be lucky if we even see a single island!"
The messenger's attitude towards their announcement had probably fueled the legionaries' barrage of mocking insults towards the messenger, who now stood helpless against the brewing storm that is an angered crowd.
Yet, the messenger continued to drone on about the "earth-shattering significance" of this mission. His words bounced off the crowd like pebbles against a fortress wall, doing little to dent the growing tension that's just waiting to erupt. Each word that escaped his lips felt hollower than a helmet. Where was the sense of purpose? The nobility of sacrifice? This whole expedition reeked of a drunken tavern tale, not a glorious conquest! A "what-if" scenario disguised as a heroic odyssey, a gamble disguised as a noble quest. Sure, the whole legion's collective intelligence might be duller than a wooden sword, but at least we spoke perfect latin, we were still people.
The messenger might as well have sung nursery rhymes for all the impact the words had. The legionnaires, burned-out, tired and discontent, weren't buying it a single word. Eyes deepened, fists clenched tighter and a low rumble began to brew through the crowd, a storm right beneath the surface.
Amidst the blabbering the messenger droned on and on forever, a sudden, yet powerful line striked at my very soul.
"The First Cohort of Legion XII have been chosen for this heroic expedition," the messenger boomed, his voice crackling with forced authority, "they will depart in a few moments. Everyone else prepare the ships and part goodbyes to your fellow comrades."
A collective gasp jolted through the crowd. That's… my cohort, We were battered, weary and barely fit for another campaign in the frozen north, let alone a voyage into the unknown. We weren't the strongest, the fastest or the newest recruits. The once-mocking crowd, their laughter now a chilling memory, erupted. Shouts and curses filled the air with those lucky enough to not be chosen giving us their helpless glances to their doomed comrades.
The messenger's empty reassurances rang hollow. Why the westward expedition? If there WERE new lands to conquer, wouldn't they be closer? Something more guaranteed to boost support, morale and fill the depleted coffers? Even better, why us? Why burned-out troops, when younger, more energetic troops sounded more appealing? Hell, why send legionnaires when auxiliary reserves are usually first pick? Where did they go!? This wasn't about glory or conquest, the senate went mad!

Chapter V

The morning exploded like a child bursting into a quiet play, trumpets blared their war cries, their notes laced with enough urgency to split the waves. Distant shouts dashed through the tents, a chaotic mix of "volunteers!" and "oh gods, not this again!", phrases that sent curiosity and shivers down spines like lightning.
Hunger lingered at my guts, barely satisfied by a pathetic chunk of hardtack I choked down before sprinting towards the heart of the camp like a ferret with a sudden burst of existential dread. My heart hammered against my ribs, a drum solo keeping pace with my panicked steps.
There, in the eye of the hurricane of panicked legionnaires, stood Titus, who looked like they hadn't slept since the invention of insomnia. He was surrounded by six other men. Their argument holds enough tension to liven a small city, punctuated by wild gestures and shouts louder than a herd of drunken elephants. The scene rippled out from the center of the camp, shaking the flimsy tents and causing even the birds in the forest to take cover.
A predawn chill slithered through the air, clinging to legionnaires who stumbled out of their tents like drunken sailors. Deep lines, like canyons carved by a lifetime of misery crammed into a single night, etched themselves onto the faces of the soldiers.
Suddenly, Titus marched towards us, each step extinguishing the chatter, one voice at a time. He came to a screeching halt in the center of the camp, his gaze sweeping over the countless faces staring back at him with a mixture of curiosity and the kind of despair that could cloud the sun's rays.
"SOLDIERS!" He boomed, crackling with urgency. "The high command requires brave volunteers to join me along with these brave souls to embark on a vital mission, tasked with delivering a message of utmost importance back to Rome. Those valiant souls who step forward will be handsomely rewarded upon arrival."
News of the mission spread like wildfire through the ranks. Exhaustion and demoralization had taken its blow on our guts but many kept hopeful and saw this as a lifeline, a chance to escape the ever-present threat of impending doom and the looming fear of starvation.
Yet, the weight of distant memories seemed to hold them rooted to the spot. My body, weary from the relentless hardships felt a flicker of something that vaguely resemble hope, a chance to perhaps escape not just from danger, but the grinding duties that had become my very own existence. I glanced nervously at others, searching for a sign, a glimmer of desperation that mirrored my own. But my comrade's faces remained unchanging, a mask I couldn't decipher, hiding any shred of emotion.
"I'm in," I muttered, the words cutting through the oppressive silence like a blade. Heads snapped in my direction, disbelief flickering across their faces. Even Titus, expecting hushed murmurs at best, seemed stunned.
"Uh… very well, brave Marcus!" he boomed, "Anyone else?" His question fell on deaf ears as even more murmurs came back. 
A hand landed on my shoulder, pulling me from the vortex of the crowd's reaction. It was Aulus, "Have you lost your mind, Marcus!?" he rasped, his voice a faint whisper. "Another journey across the watery nightmare!?"
"We've been nothing but a nuisance to the natives, how long do you think they can bottle-up their frustration?" I replied, my voice surprisingly steady, "the sea offers a quicker death than a thousand spears"
A stunned, but understanding nod answered, in hindsight, such decisions are the stuff of drunken foolishness, though, pessimism already reigned over the land before this daring announcement was even thought of.
Stepping forward felt surreal, the weight of countless eyes boring into my back. "A bold choice, Marcus," Titus rumbled, his voice laced with a hint of begrudging respect. "Welcome to your new crew, pack your things and lets go"
My reply was a curt nod. 
Pacing towards my tent, I couldn't escape the gloom that had taken over the camp. Faces, once brimming with determination now sagged with exhaustion and fear. Depleted rations and ever-present threat of violence had taken their toll on all. Every rustle of leaves amplified our paranoia and every shadow a potential foe. The thought of an impending assault or a slow, agonizing death by famine gnawed at us relentlessly.
Reaching my makeshift tent, I frantically threw my few belongings into a battered sack. Gone was the care I took my belongings; all that mattered now was squeezing in whatever might be useful on the journey. Doubt slowly brewed within. Was I making the right choice? Neptune's wrath, the churning sea, a ferocious goddess who claimed countless lives.
But here, on this unforgiving land, the future seemed even bleaker. The natives, once wary observers, now viewed us with tense hatred. We had been a nuisance, locusts that descended upon their lands, devouring resources and leaving behind a trail of destruction. Although their retaliations were not troublesome, the memory of Corvus, the desperate screams of our comrades, still haunt us to this very day.
Goodbyes were exchanged in hushed tones, a stark contrast to the boisterous tones that once filled the camp. Some offered tight handshakes, some offered words of encouragement while others simply nodded, but beyond their hushed voices, their faces etched with a mixture of envy and resignation. Maybe some saw this as an escape, a chance to break free from this purgatory even if it meant facing the terrors of the sea twice.
As the trip to the coast began, the ever-present memories of unseen creatures in the jungle slowly faded. My steps were lighter, my gaze fixed on the horizon, a sliver of hope blooming in my chest.
The trek was punctuated by snippets of conversation, carried on the humid breeze of the land. Two legionnaires walking in front especially caught my ear, their voices laced with a grim urgency. "...nothing but wishes to our brothers left behind, don't you think Lucius?" one rasped. "The natives fought with such fury, dozens of men were reported missing" the man remarked, pausing briefly for air.
"Those numbers are from last week, with the current rate of escalation, Mars may favor the barbarians over his very own worshippers!"
My initial relief at leaving morphed into a worry for the fate of those left behind, maybe… the countless whispers of vanishing men hold a terrible, yet certain truth, afterall, we were a meager thousand facing with such barbarians potentially outnumbering our collective strength, i could only pray for my comrade's health
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the labyrinth gave way to a breathtaking shore. The vast expanse of the ocean stretched before us, a canvas of shimmering blue under a cloudless sky. Here, on this wooden vessel, I craved the familiar sting of the salty air and the rhythmic groan of the ship battling the waves.
The small but agile vessel, dwarfed by the immensity of the ocean, awaited its passengers. As we boarded, a flurry of activity erupted. We were a small crew of eight, each face with the weariness of the ordeal. Yet, a spark of determination, a shared purpose that transcended any personal fear.
Before long, the crew was swamped. Not with the usual pre-voyage tasks, but with a barrage of handwritten messages. Legionnaires, desperate for any connection with loved ones back in Rome, thrust scraps of parchment into our hands, their pleas etched in hurried strokes. The weight of their hopes, their fears, settled heavily upon us. We weren't just carrying a message back to Rome; we were carrying the very wishes, hopes and dreams of many in this far-off land.
With a final groan of protest, the rickety ship lurched away from the verdant shore, leaving behind the emerald embrace of the new world. We had faced the unknown terrors of the jungle, and now, we will face the familiar wrath of Neptune. Or so we expected.
Memories of their harrowing journey to this new world were fresh in our minds, days battling relentless storms, the sky a churning canvas of fury, the sea a monstrous beast determined to swallow them whole. This time, however, the vast ocean stretched before them like a blue mirror, reflecting the merciless gaze of the sun. Not a single whitecap marred the surface, and the only sound was the rhythmic creak of the ship and the gentle lap of waves against the hull.
An unsettling quiet descended. This unnatural calm, a stark contrast to the furious winds they'd received before, sent shivers down many spines. It felt wrong, a sinister foreshadowing to a coming storm of unimaginable wrath. Faces hardened with a grim determination. This wasn't a time for relaxation.
Superstitious whispers filled the air, prayers muttered to Neptune and any other deities who might hold sway over the seas. Rituals, both personal and communal, were observed, offerings tossed overboard, amulets clutched tightly. Seasoned sailors, faces etched with lines that spoke of countless battles with the elements, moved with a practiced efficiency.
Hatches were battened down with a resounding clang, securing all supplies and personal belongings deep down. Masts were double-reinforced, every rope and sail meticulously checked for any strain of weaknesses. We may not know what form the storm would take, but we know it was coming. This unnatural calm was merely the eye of a mighty hurricane, a deceiving sight before the inevitable storm.
With a shared sense of desperation, everyone inside the small vessel braced themselves for the fury. We were a fragile driftwood carrying a message of desperation, a lifeline to those left behind. The unnaturally calm seas mocked our extensive preparations, a silent challenge that mirrored the question that burrowed at our souls. Would the message reach Rome or would we get swallowed whole by the very sea we sought to appease?
We'd braced ourselves for a storm of epic proportions, that fierce, bearded pirate of the sea, waves like mountains, howling winds, rain of a thousand needles and an infinite siege. Instead, an unsettling stillness descended with the only sounds daring to disturb the silence were the ship's creaky hull, waves lapping against the ship like a puppy.
The desperate pleas of those left behind lingering in the winds, a constant reminder of the burden we carry. The silence, however, was a beast that couldn't be ignored. One by one, the crew emerged from their silence, seeking comfort in shared experiences.
Titus, beard as tangled as a jungle vine, kicked things off with a small tale, he spoke of wyverns, their leathery colossal wings blocking out the sun as they soared through the upper reaches of the jungle canopy. Their roars, a bone-chilling shriek that split the very air we breathe, rippling through the dense foliage and striking terror deep into the hearts of even the bravest legionnaires. 
He recounted one particular night's patrol, cloaked in unnatural darkness, where one of these beasts swooped down with terrifying swiftness. Its shadow falling down to a poor soldier, and with a sickening crunch, it left a terrible dent the size of a temple offering in his shield. Thankfully, the poor soul escaped with his life, but the memory still clung like a leech, especially to Titus, a harsh reminder that this new world will never exactly be a walk in the park.
Lucius, a fresh-faced recruit with more enthusiasm than logic, offered a more grounded, yet terrifying tale. He spoke of a "Dutch Dragon," or "Batavica Draconis" if you are feeling particularly roman. This nightmare didn't concern itself with the inconvenience of wings. No, this beast was built low to the ground, about the height of a man but twice as angry. Like a lizard the size of a bear with short, grasping hands like crabs and a tail that could crack a spine like a twig.
He recounted a rumor, whispers carried on the jungle breeze of two soldiers who encountered this very "Dutch dragon" while on a routine patrol. The beast, initially curious, tilted its head in seeming innocence. But when one of the soldiers, driven by shock, swung his sword, the beast reacted with lightning speed. Snatching the sword mid-swing and with a single, brutal swipe, sliced the soldier's leg and pounced at his shield, shattering it into a million splinters with one fierce bite. The other soldier, frozen like deers, could only watch in horror as his friend was dragged away into the dark abyss that is the jungles, leaving behind nothing but a dented helmet and a shattered dream. The beast reportedly attacked with the ferocity of ten Dutch warriors on an easy day, hence the name.
My own experience, while not quite as monster-in-your-face terrifying, was no less amusing, I shared my only experience with the strange lands, be it the encounter with the natives, although initially everything went peacefully-ish, the questions it sparked were endless. Were they intelligent? Were they the ones causing all the trouble? Or were they just another piece in the puzzle of this bizarre new world, a world that twisted everything we thought we knew into a mix of the unexpected?
As the sun beat down, each story painted a vivid picture of this fantastical world, a world brimming with life both beautiful and terrifying, a world that whispered promises of adventure and discoveries, but also whispered of dangers unlike anything we'd ever faced. Like thorns beneath a rose.

Chapter VI

The first few days at sea were a whirlwind of frantic activity. Memories of Neptune's tyranny are still fresh in our minds, we would never forget the stinging rain, we would never forget the deadly waves and we would certainly never forget the carnage that is the consequence of underestimation.
Titus surveyed the scene with a practiced eye, the blank expanse of water is all I see for miles on-end, though, I'm sure Titus could see Alexandria with this unseen before attitude.
"Don't let hope cloud your judgment lads. The ocean can be as deceiving as a viper. prepare for the storm as if it's upon us, not when it finally decides to greet us."
The crew scurried about, this time armed with knowledge of past experiences, we reinforced masts, tightened ropes and battened down any hatches we saw. Every creak of the ship, every ripple in the water a reminder of what under preparation might bring. We may have been Landlocked dwellers, but the ocean casted deep canyons within our souls, and we are treating it with a healthy dose of fear.
As the panic dissipates, a tense calm settles over the ship. Huddled below deck, the crew shared yet even more hushed stories and nervous laughter, a collective bracing for the inevitable. Faces scanned the horizon, searching for the first signs of Neptune's wrath, any odd cloud, any odd winds and any odd waters a red flag in our eyes. 
Days bled into one another, the rhythmic creaking of the hull morphing from a background into a constant reminder of our precarious situation. Absolutely nothing could entertain my mind in this ship with the constant shoutings of men playing dice and poker all the fleet could provide, a meager murmur of voices against the undefying swing of the cabin.
"Maybe the rumors are true," Lucius remarked, the sound shattering the brittle silence. "Maybe Neptune granted us a safe passage home."
Titus however, remained unconvinced. "It's too quiet," he said, "The sea's a vicious viper, engrave that in your brain for once…"
"It's been days since we departed! A quick glance and maybe you'll understand old gramps!" Lucius spat.
"A calm sea can be just as dangerous as a raging one," Titus said, his voice low and gravelly but dense with the aura of wisdom. "It lures souls into a sense of security, only to strike when they least expect it."
"Aye," Lucius grunted, his voice a mixture of fear and understanding. "Maybe this time, the sea will show us some mercy…"
Days bled into the next, bracing for any storm that might pounce… but such storm never truly arrived, yet the oppressive calm continued to stretch on for days, The churning seas we braced for remained unchanging with the storm's absence a complete mystery, leaving behind a silence that spoke volumes more than any thunderstorm could muster.
One particularly dull afternoon, amidst my staring contest with the floorboards, a cry pierced the oppressive silence. "Pillars of hercules! We're entering the mediterranean!" It was Lucius, his voice tinged with a tremor of excitement that cut through the air like a knife.
A collective jolt of energy surged through the crew. We swarmed the railing, their eyes scanning the horizon in a desperate search for any sign of land. Even the ever-stoic Titus seemed to dash towards the railing, a flicker of hope momentarily chasing away the grim line on his face.
"Where?" Titus boomed.
"There, sir!" Lucius pointed, towards the distant blue, his finger trembling slightly. "Hispania to the left, Africa to the right"
The Pillars of Hercules, lumbering on the distant horizon, the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. A landmark we wouldn't encounter for weeks, yet here it was, defying all logic.
Titus, however, remained unconvinced. He narrowed his eyes at the distant horizon, his gaze sharp as a hawk's. "Hallucination," he grunted, his voice low and dismissive. "Weeks cooped up below deck have gotten the better of your eyes boy. all of you! Back to your duties! Nothing to see here."
Disappointment clouded Lucius' face within the drop of a hat, mumbling a sheepish apology before retreating back into the crowd. The others, their excitement stomped by Titus' words, slowly dispersed, the murmur of disbelief fading into silence. 
Yet, beneath the surface, I couldn't really shake-off the lingering doubt that seemed to grow. The oppressive calm, the unnatural stillness, and now this supposed hallucination, all of it sapped any dwindling sanity we had, leaving us questioning not only our surroundings, but their very perception of reality.
Mopping the grimy deck, I moved along with the sluggish efficiency I sensed all around me with the sloshing of seawater against the hull was the only soundtrack to the purgatory, accompanied by the endless expanse of blue in the background.
Just two days ago, a tremor of excitement had ripped through the ship. With Lucius swearing he witnessed the Pillars of Hercules, no less. Titus, ever the pragmatist, dismissed it as cabin fever. Much to the dismay of many.
Then, a tremor, a subtle shift that sent a shiver down my spine. Not the familiar chill of the ocean breeze, but a prickling unease that pokes at the edges of my eyes. Squinting into the endless expanse, I scanned the horizon. The endless blue remained unbroken except a small smudge over in the distance.
What might it be? Storm clouds!? No, it was too low for any cloud formation. Could this also be another figment of my mind? Perhaps spending weeks on-end down in the cramped cabins had strained my vision.
"Everyone on the horizon upfront!" I shouted, my voice a welcome disruption to the tense silence. A scramble of footsteps followed as the crew surged towards the railing. Nervous questions filled the air. No eyes proved superior amongst ourselves as most began speculating, adding more fuel to the dizzying firestorm of thoughts. Was it land? An enemy vessel?
"Looks like a brewing storm on the horizon!" one sailor muttered, a voice that mirrored my unease. 
Titus, ever the leader, surveyed the scene once again, this time with a practiced eye. He understood our desperation for change, a break from the monotony below deck. Glancing at me, he saw the same spark of yearning reflected in my eyes.
"Normally I'd dismiss such claims out of hand," Titus rumbled, a hint of unease creeping into his voice. "Just like young Lucius and his 'Pillars of Hercules' two days ago. But…" He trailed off, his gaze fixed on the distant smudge. "Those… those rocks…"
Eyes strained towards the jagged monstrosity that might mark the end of our problems, and perhaps, the beginning of a handful more.
With newfound urgency, the crew immediately sprang into action. Sails were adjusted, ropes coiled, every man working in a desperate bid to reach the smudge in the distance. The ship, as if sensing the frantic energy, lurched forward, ripping through the waters like a deadly blade. Slowly, the distant smudge on the horizon began to take shape, transforming into a sight that sent a fresh wave of shock through our souls.

Chapter VII

Nestled against a mountain range, was a sight that brought tears to some eyes and disbelief to others, the unmistakable sprawl of a city, not just any city, but Rome itself. The city that pulsed with life, a beacon of civilization among the uncharted chaos we grew accustomed to. Here, our journey would end. Whether it would be a triumphant homecoming or a desperate plea for help, only time would tell. Yet, one thing was certain, our world, once a comforting globe we knew, had forever changed.
Yet, as we pulled into the harbor, the oblivious city life unfolding served as a stark reminder that the fate of our comrades and the very existence of a fantastical new world remained unknown to a world in blissful ignorance.
Docking the ship in one of many harbors, the harbor master approached with a disinterested wave as we secured the vessel to the dock. The usual paperworks, inspections and the monotonous exchange of coins followed soon. News of our arrival didn't seem to penetrate the thick bog of Roman bureaucracy yet, it might need some time until a single soul hears anything. 
Disembarking in Rome felt like stepping into a churning anthill. The docks buzzing with an energy unlike anything we'd ever experienced. Unlike the sleepy local ports of our distant provinces, this was the beating heart of the Empire. Towering ships from the furthest corners of the known world sat next to each other, their painted sails a breathtaking mix of colors against the cyan sky. Shouts of haggling merchants and complaining sailors mingled with the laughter of children and the rhythmic clang of hammers from a nearby shipyard. 
"God, look at those things" muttered Lucius, his eyes wide with awe. "The size of those ships! They must carry enough grain to feed the whole empire for a year."
For most of us, it was our first glimpse of the capital. We've spent most of our lives on dusty frontiers and modest towns, barred from even stepping foot in the italian peninsula, the only image of the grand city came from faded scrolls and whispered legends. Now, we stood at the beating heart of a city that pulsed with life. With each breath we inhaled, the alluring fumes of exotic spices and the metallic tang of freshly forged weapons overwhelmed our noses. Our hands, accustomed to the rough grip of swords and javelins, itched with the anticipation of exploring the city's famed marble streets.
We gathered on the docks, stretching our stiff muscles, the rhythmic groans of the ship nothing but a fading memory. The journey, fraught with isolation and paranoia, had finally led us here. A lone officer, face etched with an aura of a seasoned bureaucrat approached the vessel. With a practiced eye, we handed the crate overflowing with the messages, a tangible link back to our comrades, each scrap of parchment, leaf and cloth brimming with hopes and fears. After a curt nod, the officer disappeared into the concrete labyrinth of Rome, carrying the crateful of messages and our fate with it.
Left behind, we felt a wave of relief washing over. Our duty was done… for now. The weight of our mission, the growing uncertainty of the past weeks seems to dissipate momentarily. A well-deserved rest awaits, a respite before we face whatever response the senators got in store. But beyond that, a different kind of anticipation started to brew. We were free, for a time, to explore the legendary city, a city whose very name whispered promises of grand spectacles, opulent palaces and untold wonders. This was an adventure itself, a chance to experience firsthand the heart of the Empire we served.
"Aye, I wouldn't mind a decent meal myself. Nothing but salted fish with solid hardtack for days on that damned ship." I chuckled, my spirit lived through the journey with the promise of solid ground, 
"Alright, lads," boomed Titus, his voice coarse, but firm. "First order of business, lodgings. We need a place to rest our bones before the senate says a single word."
Having never stepped foot in Rome before, we managed to find ourselves navigating the daunting streets like clueless fools amidst the bustling streets rife with activities. We were complete strangers in this bustling metropolis, our thick provincial accents drawing curious glances from passers by.
Looking for a place to stay in for the night proved to be our first hurdle, the initial symphony of urban bustle morphed into a mess of unfamiliar sounds, rhythmic hammering of a cobbler, cries of a street vendor and rambunctious laughter spilling out of taverns just to name a few.
"Look at that one," Lucius pointed, "A modest tavern with enough room for a thousand people!" He gestured towards an otherwise bland block of concrete with square holes carved into its side. 
"decent enough." Titus remarked, his eyes analyzing the structure down to every paint stroke.
With tired smiles, we approached the entrance. A wiry man with sweat clinging to his brow emerged from behind a counter, piled high with chipped mugs and greasy plates. He wiped his hands on a rag that looked like it had gone through more than Titus' shield, leaving behind dark smears.
"Welcome! What can I do for ya?" His voice held a forced cheer that didn't quite reach his soulless eyes yet.
"Rooms for the night," Titus replied, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. "Eight of us, weary from a long journey."
The man's smile faltered. He glanced at us, his gaze lingering on our worn clothing and sun-beaten faces.
"Rooms, eh? That'll be five silver coins a night, each."
Five silvers!? That was nearly a week's wages for a common laborer! We'd envisioned bustling markets overflowing with goods and a city brimming with prosperity, a stark contrast to the meager living standard we'd endured at sea.
"Five silver coins?" I choked, my voice laced with thick disbelief. "For a night?"
The tavern keeper's smile faltered, his voice laced with a hint of condescension. "Take it or leave it, look… prices have gone up a tad lately." He gestured vaguely with his greasy rag.
Disappointment settled over the crew like a shroud. The image of a grand city overflowing with riches started to crumble like the building itself. Our meager savings, carefully guarded during the voyage, wouldn't stretch far in this city of ungodly prices. A pound of bread could bankrupt all of us it seemed.
"We… we'll need some time to discuss this abhorrent pricing" Titus stammered, his face simmering with anger. The tavern keeper in turn, gazed Titus from head to toe, with eyes hinting a tad bit of annoyance.
"I'm offering you a bargain here! Maybe next time, try considering not slacking off at work. Just a simple thought." The comment brimming with sarcasm, a stark reminder of the current position we are in, weary travelers with depleted purses in a city where the very air drains the value of gold.
The keeper's words did nothing but infuriate the already-angry Titus. Before things could escalate, we collectively restrained the bear that is our commander, who is probably moments away from slicing the whole building in half. 
With heavy hearts, everyone retreated back to the harbor. The promise of a warm meal and a comfortable bed had quickly evaporated, replaced by the bitter reality of a city where even the empire's treasury would barely afford a night's rest.
We entered Rome with the city of marble enthusiastic and naively envisioned, and left Rome with the reality of a city of stone devastatingly carved in our soul. The mood, just like the hopes and dreams of a comfortable rest, lays dead and silent.
The ship, despite its cramped quarters and suffocating cabins now seemed like home compared to the harsh realities of Roman life. Tonight at least, we would find comfort in the familiar creak of the hull and the rhythmic churnes of the waves. But sleep, if it came at all, would be fragile. The weight of the message pressed on our chest, a burden that sleep could only delay.
Tomorrow, we will face the true test. The verdict that would determine the fate of not just ourselves, but the fate of the thousands left behind in the emerald hell, the fate of so many souls lay within the cold marble halls of power. We were mere pawns on a chessboard far grander than any could comprehend, our lives and the lives of our comrades depend on the whims of unseen hands.
Lucius fidgeted with the hilt of his sword, his youthful aura replaced by an ever-present anxiety. Even seasoned veterans like Titus, with faces etched with the lines of countless battles couldn't hide the unease within their hands.
I scanned the faces of my crewmates, a sense of desperate hope battling against a rising tide of doubt as the last sliver of sunlight dipped below the horizon, anticipating an answer to our question. Would our pleas be heard or would it be lost in the thick swamp of Roman bureaucracy?
The answer, and the fate of countless lives would dawn with the coming day.

Chapter VIII

The rhythmic creak of the ship, a calming background sound that had dominated the cabins now replaced by the symphony of a bustling city, pulsing with a chaotic energy that rivaled the busiest towns up north. Voices rose and lingered throughout the night, periodically interrupted by the clack of sandals on cobblestones. Such was the night in Rome.
The rest of the crew, blessed with divine resilience, somehow managed to slumber almost immediately while I was stuck in my bed unfortunately placed closest to a particularly rousey ship with rambunctious laughter emanating through the layers of wood and into my ears, taunting at my wide-open eyes and ears, much to my irritation. Only after an eternity of shuffling and staring did the gods show any mercy and put me to slumber in a heartbeat.
The following morning was no less jarring though. With sailors and their hoarse voices, wrestling sacks and crates onto waiting ships. The sheer volume of activity and the constant bustle left me estranged in a new world, again.
Groaning, I stumbled about in the cramped space, Making my way onto the cluttered deck, trying my best to navigate around the sacks and backpacks that litter the cabin floor. As I slowly emerged, The first rays of dawn blinded my eyes as hues of orange and pink slowly cluttered my vision, casting a godly glow on the cityscape that loomed before me. 
Taking a deep breath of air, the tang of salt and the faint sweetness of something unfamiliar accompanied my morning routine of a quick rinse with saltwater, a scrub of a shared bar of lye soap and a change into yesterday's crusty and stiff clothes. Below deck, a gruff man took the unofficial role of cook with a visible tint of resentment, preparing the usual hardtack biscuits that were about as appealing as sand along with dwindling rations of salted fish and pork, it's not horrible, just the kind that could weather a storm and still leave you yearning for something else. 
Joining the rest of the crew, I sat against the ship's railings with my boiling-hot canteen on my lap and my bottle of barely-filtered ocean water on the side, listening-in to the ship's usual morning chatter that was about as interesting as a brick. As the sun rose, I found myself gazing into the sea of busy people going-about their normal lives, scanning for anything other than the unfamiliar torrent of activity, anything familiar, anything I could recognise. Yet the chaotic firestorm of urban Rome greeted me. Nothing but movement for what feels like miles to the horizon.
Amidst my endless stare to the crowd, a silhouette stood-out, slowly drawing closer with that ever so familiar crimson glow. It had been days, neigh, months even since we had left the known world to the emerald hell, such delusional sights could very well be a mere figment of my imagination, mischievous Gods toying with my very eyes. Yet, against my constant dismissals, the figure continued to grow closer and closer nonetheless, slowly taking shape as time slowly passed. revealing a messenger, an imperial messenger.
Unlike the usual dread that punched my gut, the slap of anticipation followed through, this time spreading to the entire crew with their eyes catching onto the unforgettable crimson hue that terrorized us for years up north.
"Here we go again" a crewman muttered, the voice dashing through the air and straight into our ears with horrifying clarity.
"Lets see what this schmuck got in-store for us" Titus grumbled, tossing down his canteen on the wooden deck, the metallic clang snapping me from my rabbit-hole of thoughts, and back into reality
"Are you Titus Valerius?" the messenger asked, face brimming with urgency.
"Yep. That's me," Titus paused, time halted for a second before he continued "Oddly quick to a response… anyways, bring it on"
"The Senate received your message along with detailed naval directions to this allusive 'new world'" The messenger paused. "Along with some… deeply personal letters by the hundreds you might have forgotten about.". Our faces mirrored his discomfort with a collective sigh aimed at the care-free postal worker we naively handed out to.
"Of course, there was an error in the postal sector somewhere," He continued, waving dismissively. "Not to get sidetracked! The Senate heard your pleas and approved a full campaign"
"Alright fellas, you heard that, let's sail back to our legion" Titus roared, his voice full of determination, but before he could muster a speech, the messenger tapped him on the shoulder, signaling that yes, the messenger got more to say, plenty more.
"Legion XII is currently unavailable for a campaign." he paused, clearing his throat before continuing. "Fleets are stationed in Portus Hannibalis, Hispania, ready for orders. They would fit for this campaign"
The quick and rushed response from the messenger seemed out of place. The little to no details might sign that something is astray somewhere, especially the absence of lengthy monologues the messenger usually droned on and on about, just a "whatever just go" kind of attitude towards what should be a groundbreaking discovery.
"You heard that, ready the ship boys!" Titus commanded, thrusting the whole ship into a current of frenetic energy with a once powerful voice.
As we scrambled to ready the ship for yet another odyssey, the chaotic whirlwind of movement that is the decks suddenly morphed into a harrowing storm as ropes were coiled, sails were meticulously checked for any sign of wear, crates were nailed into place and weapons were polished until they gleamed in the sun. Even the usually laid-back Lucius seemed to get caught in the hurricane of frantic energy, moving around with newfound energy, the weight of responsibility replacing his usual carefree demeanor.
Standing on deck, I surveyed the city skyline of Rome for the last time, its inhabitants teeming with activity going about their usual lives while utterly oblivious to the adventure that awaits us on the other side of the globe, adventures rife with the promise of laden bounties of untold potential.
Departing from the harbor felt surreal. A mix of emotions swirled within me, relief at the freedom from inhumane prices and urban noise, yet, it came at the cost, seeing Rome for the last time before getting thrust into another yet campaign casted a resentful sigh at an experience taken away as fast as it had come to us.
"Alright, men!" Titus boomed across the deck, cutting through the air of salt and the distant bustle of the city. "Two days, that's all it should take to reach Hispania. Use this time to mend any dents and scratches in your gear. Hispania will at least be more affordable to us bloaks"
An empty chuckle rippled through the crew. Hispania, a mere pit stop before the real storm.
"Soldiers! Remember our purpose on this mission, we have sailed across the watery abyss, we have sailed with the hopes, dreams and pleas of our brothers we left behind, we were on our last leg, our last breath and the gods had spared us from certain death!"
Titus then suddenly bursted into a roaring inferno. "We were battered, broken! Left for dead! Now, we rise from the ashes! With the fury of a cornered bear and the strength of a charging elephant, we'll crush those barbarians and empower our comrades from the tyranny of blades! Once and for all!"
His words ignited a firestorm within the men. Latin and Greek rally cries erupted in a symphony of defiance that dashed through the waves. 
The ship pulsed with raw energy. Men slapped each other on the back and laughter echoed through the decks. Brotherhood, forged in the grasps of hardship and desperation, seemed to solidify the very air.
As dusk settled, casting the sea in a twilight of orange , the energy began to wane. The men retreated below deck, their camaraderie fading into distant murmurs. The ship once again fell into familiar silence.
Alone at the bow, I braced myself against the icy wind. The endless horizon greeting me in an horizon of endless orange. I couldn't help but ponder the recent chain of events through the eyes of the barbarians. What it must feel like for hundreds of men descending from ships and plundering towns and villages that did nothing, I could only hope everyone was safe, though such outcomes are just that, hopes.

Chapter IX

Two suns had risen and sank on the horizon since Titus' tall tale of Hispania rising from the sea in two measly days. The ocean stretched on forever, a flat, mocking sheet of the most soul-crushingly solid slab of blue a man could ever imagine. Countless days at sea since our arrival to the emerald hell had swapped our "when do we get there?" for a soul-sucking "if we get there"
Then, a call shattered the thick and oppressive silence. "All hands on deck!" the voice boomed, a much needed disruption to the monotonous misery. But instead of the usual scramble fueled by burning curiosity, the crew just shrugged, a collective "meh" echoing through the air. We lumbered about readying the ship with the enthusiasm of a hangover slug climbing Mount Olympus.
As we inched closer, the speck on the horizon grew larger with every second. The initially hazy blur solidified into land, jagged, imposing, and sporting a port that teemed with life. But this wasn't the sleepy little harbor we'd pictured. Portus Hannibalis had transformed into a beehive of activity, a dense jungle of Roman military transports with masts that scraped the sky. A jolt of excitement, chased by a healthy dose of dread, ran through the crew. The last time we'd seen those military ships, it had been a one-way ticket to that emerald hellhole. This time though, at least we knew where we were headed, but the dread still clung to us like a particularly stubborn barnacle, a bitter aftertaste in our mouths.
As we got closer, the sheer scale of activity slammed like a battering ram. The air was noticeably reeking of tar, salt, and fresh-forged steel, a both terrifying and exhilarating cocktail of air. Our driftwood of a ship, a mere rowboat compared to the monstrous warships crowding the harbor, our creaky and battered vessel, the only companion for days on end, would now yield its duty in a calm bay nestled between an imposing city. A majestic warship awaits.
Disembarking felt surreal. Leaving behind the familiar groans of their ship, we stepped onto solid ground. The harbor was rife with a military rhythm, the clanging of armor, the barked orders, the efficient bustle of soldiers loading crates. No stroll through a market for these sailors. This was a well-oiled war machine churning into action, ready to slice across the endless sea.
In the distance, a figure stood out like a peacock in a penguin colony. This wasn't your average sailor Joe, his tunic bursted with colors and enough bling to blind a Cyclops. Clearly a high office of some sort, the likes of which even the know-it-all Titus had never seen outside of bedtime stories.
Titus, the only one among us with a shred of authority, puffed-up his chest and marched towards the man with the response-message clutching in his hand, while the rest of the crew scurried about like ants, Titus and the high-ranking officer chatted casually before strolling towards the ship, nonchalance in the face of impending war.
"Here it is, sir!" Titus barked, his voice laden with a forced and somewhat pathetic attempt at authority.
Every eye was drawn towards a figure standing beside Titus, a mountain of a man with shoulders wider than a chariot and a gaze that could curdle milk. He practically emanated authority so potent that even the saltiest sailor wanted to straighten their posture. The officer barely glanced at the message before raising a skeptical eyebrow. "New men in my fleet?" he scoffed, taking a second look. "I hadn't expected any."
He addressed the crew directly, his voice cutting through the clatter and shouts of the harbor. "You guys are new recruits, aren't you?" A beat of silence followed, punctuated only by the rhythmic creak of a nearby ship. "Only eight," he continued, his voice laced with disbelief as he surveyed our meager group. "Unheard of."
He tossed the message scroll casually in his hand, the expensive wax seal glinting in the harsh daylight. "This whole thing would be swimming with the fishes if it wasn't for the emblem."
Doubt clouded his face like a sudden storm. "Look," he grumbled, "gotta run this through the other guys before you're officially part of the fleet". He swiveled on his heel and paced purposefully away. There we stood, stranded in the middle of a bustling port, feeling like a bunch of lost puppies.
"This is it," Lucius muttered, his normally optimistic voice thick with pessimism. "A thousand souls hanging on the thumbs of one man."
Titus, bless his cotton socks, clapped Lucius on the shoulder with a force that could have knocked a bear unconscious. "Hey, chin up! We're probably stuck here for quite some time, might as well rest, fix your gear, take a nap, whatever floats your boat. We just gotta wait and see what the fates have in store, eh?" He shot us a strained smile before dashing off towards a nearby tavern. Months, maybe even years of service had clearly taken a toll. But unlike Titus, most of us couldn't afford decent ale or even a mediocre meal, just ultra watered-down wine and enough coin to keep our bellies from imploding.
"Two measly silver coins," Lucius sighed, hefting his dented helmet like a mournful trophy. "Anyone up for a shopping spree? Prices here might be lower than Rome, I wouldn't hold my breath though."
Before the words were even fully out of his mouth, a calloused hand slapped a pouch into his palm. "Here," a gruff voice rumbled. "Two silvers. See what you can haggle for this pile of junk." The sailor shoved a mess of chipped daggers and utensils at Lucius' feets.
Like a plague of locusts descending on a field, the crew followed suit. Coins, some ancient and barely-gleaming, rained down on Lucius. Weapons, some duller than our collective understanding of philosophy, or even history clattered at his feet, a chipped breastplate, sword, and a comically wobbly javelin that looked like it crashed against a concrete wall.
Lucius stared at the shipwreck of a pile with a mix of annoyance and a begrudging sympathy for his crewmates. "Alright, alright," he grumbled, "looks like I'm your official fence today. Just remember, anything halfway decent is gonna cost you an arm and a leg."
Lucius wasn't exactly known for his bartering skills, but the prospect of escaping the suffocating tension and exploring this bustling port was too good to pass up.
"Is this everything?" he called out, but was met with our collective mumbles and shrugs. With a sigh that could have rivaled the gods, Lucius lifted the overflowing sack onto his shoulder, muttering curses under his breath about the weight. Without another word, he plunged into the throng of merchants and soldiers, a lone wolf navigating a sea with a treasure trove slung over his back.
Just as we thought we were done for the day, a tidal wave of marching legionnaires surged towards our ship, led by none other than the peacock officer himself. This time, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. It was a storm cloud with a side of suspicion.
"You! All of you!" he barked, his voice cracking like a whip, sending shivers down the whole world's spine. The crew, who moments ago were lost in conversations, snapped to attention, their heads swiveling and locking to the officer.
As the officer stalked towards our vessel, it became clear this wasn't a casual stroll. His shoulders were wider like a predator ready to pounce and fists clenching. He stopped just out of arm's reach, crossed his arms and eyed the crew with eyes that could split a mountain.
"Guess what" he snarled, a pause following through before he flung the scroll at me like a discarded rag. I barely managed to snag it before it smacked me in the face. "Looks like you guys dodged a fish buffet" His voice dripped with suspicion, thick enough to flood the harbor.
A wave of confusion washed over, then when our brains woke up, confusion quickly morphed into relief. Gaius, as he introduced himself, might have paced and emitted tangible anger like a storm waiting to happen, but this sudden shift from borderline furious to harbinger of good news was a welcome dagger of relief, even if it pierced our hearts with a touch of bewilderment.
Gaius, seemingly blissfull of the stunned silence hanging over us, barked our assignment, his voice echoing in the tense air. "Alright, listen up, landlubbers! Third ship down the line, that's your new home. Get ready because the debriefing starts tomorrow morning sharp!" He gestured vaguely towards the row of docked vessels before turning his attention to the legionnaires behind him, spewing out a novel's worth of commands that sounded like a soldier's instruction manual.
In a drop of a hat, Gaius and his merry band of warriors were gone, leaving us in the dust. Now we just had to wait for Lucius and Titus, who were likely in no state to face a high-ranking officer with eyes that could shatter solid steel.
Without a word, the crew retreated back to the ship. working with frantic efficiency, scrubbing away any trace of our messy legacy. No vaguely unprofessional behavior on Gaius's watch, not today. Not with a man wielding that much power. Bags were hastily packed and everything else hastily stuffed into sacks, neatly stacked crates disappeared, personal lockers emptied. Even the galley, usually a riot of culinary chaos, was eerily silent, pots and pans gleaming sterilely in the dim light.
"So," a sailor finally grumbled, breaking the fragile silence, "should we head over?"
"Probably for the best, both Titus and Lucius would probably ask their way to our assigned ship" I muttered, the rest of the crew shuffled along after me, a knot of unease started twisting in our guts. Who knew what kind of welcome awaited us on that third ship down the line, but one thing was certain, it wouldn't be a walk in the park.
As we shuffled towards our supposed ship, a sensory assault hit us like a brick. The unmistakable smell of freshly varnished wood, the gleaming, smooth texture of the hull, a stark contrast to the decaying wooden hilts and weathered planks we'd grown accustomed to over the years. And then there was the paint. The fresh, heady scent was intoxicating, almost addictive, a stark reminder of a luxury we hadn't experienced in ages.
A hush fell over the crew as we boarded. The familiar camaraderie that had filled our old ship was replaced by an unsettling silence. The ship was eerily empty, its inhabitants probably toiling elsewhere. Except for a couple of scribes, hunched over crates, meticulously counting whatever happened to be inside.
"Hey" i called "you fellas know any empty cabins?" 
The scribes exchanged a confused glance, followed by hushed mutterings. Silence stretched before one of them finally spoke. "You guys… new?"
A silent annoyance then crossed across my face. "Yeah," I sighed.
One of them forced out a welcome, a bit too enthusiastic to be genuine. "Welcome aboard! All the way back, to the left," he blurted, before diving back into his work.
The cabin hatch groaned open, revealing a scene both familiar and alien. The layout mirrored our old ship, bunk beds lined both sides of the walls with hooks tucked far back across the room and a cramped mess area with a communal table in the center, sure everything was tiny and cramped, but unlike the worn-out vessel we'd called home, everything here was pristine. The wood, the blankets, the air, it all held the scent of freshness. Confined within the unventilated room, the smell was overwhelming, almost suffocating.
Exhaustion from the journey had eroded us and with a weary shuffle, we started to claim our bunks, offering to settle the entirety of the right side of the cabin, leaving the other side to whoever we would share a cabin with. Everybody immediately fights for the lower bunks, though the top bunk is good enough for me. The rhythmic creak of the ship rocked gently in the harbor held promise of a good night's sleep. Others stared at the polished wood above, minds racing with questions about our new assignment and the fate hanging in balance. 
As the day wore on, the previously quiet ship began to hum with activity. Sounds of footsteps and muffled conversations filtered in from the hallway. The once-empty bunks opposite us filled with new faces, some weathered, others young recruits brimming with nervous excitement.
"Ooh, new guys?" one remarked, his eyes falling on us.
"First cohort of Legion XII, just passing through," I mumbled, my voice hoarse with fatigue.
"First cohort of legion XII?" the man continued, confusion and disbelief flickering across his face. "Didn't you guys and a couple more sail west and disappear months ago? Or am I deeply mistaken?"
"Gaius will spill the beans tomorrow" I muttered. "If I tried to explain it all now, I'd sound like a madman."
"Welcome aboard… I guess," the man offered hesitantly, before fueling a lively argument session with whoever else decided to join the fray. Nobody else seemed interested beside the unknown man, the most anyone else did was a quick glance before snapping into whatever they were doing.
"I guess we're famous now… for disappearing" I mumbled, crashing down to my bunk mid-sentence.
Just as the last sliver of sunlight began to disappear, the cabin door exploded inwards with a bang that rattled the very planks. Lucius lurched into the room, a bulging sack slung over his shoulder and draped limply across his back, snoring softly, was none other than Titus.
"Gods above," Lucius grunted, dumping Titus onto an empty bunk with a heavy thud. "This one thought a whole barrel wasn't enough."
Titus mumbled something unintelligible about gods knows what before mumbling "one more" and promptly rolling over and falling silent.
Lucius surveyed the cabin, his gaze landing on an empty bunk and our faces. "Sorry about that lads. Lost track of time at the market." he tossed the sack against a wall.
Slouching over on an empty bunk, Lucius finally gazed the other way. "looks like everybody's here" he commented, nothing but bewildered faces of a rudely-interrupted poker game met his comment.
"Oh, yeah," a sailor grunted, gesturing vaguely towards the slumbering Titus and Lucius, "they're part of us. Just… don't worry about them." With that, everyone else seemed to lose interest, proceeding to continue whatever a typical roman soldier would do.
Meanwhile, Lucius untied the sack, revealing a treasure trove of shiny new helmets, gleaming swords still sharp from the forge and a bundle of javelin and spearheads that looked with deadly promise. Laughter bubbled up among the crew, a welcome sound that cut through the atmosphere. Maybe, Lucius thought, a little humor was all they had left before the fleet set sail.

Chapter X

A haze clung to the last shreds of sleep as I stirred awake. The unfamiliar creak and groan of this completely different ship told the story, we weren't on the storm-battered vessel anymore. A sliver of morning sun peeked through a tiny gap in the already small shutters, painting a golden rectangle on the rough-hewn wooden floor.
Across a couple beds on our side, Lucius and Titus remained blissfully unaware of the world stirring around them. Titus' snores, punctuated by the occasional snuffling from Lucius filled the cramped space. The cabin slowly comes to life with every man waking up contributing to the initially hushed conversations, which had quickly swelled to a cling-clang of shuffling sacks and voices of the driest, unfunniest banter I'd ever heard. followed by a string of muttered curses, some of the other guys had grabbed their breakfast while the rest sat-back and relaxed, waiting for… something.
"Mighty god of sleep," I grumbled, collapsing onto a nearby bunk. "You two, the debriefing starts in an hour!"
Lucius stirred at the mention of the debriefing, his eyes snapping open. He shot a panicked glance at the sliver of sun and then at me. A string of colorful curses erupted from his lips, waking Titus with a start.
"Debriefing?" Titus mumbled, his voice thick with sleep. "What debriefing?" "The one about the little trip west fool!" I snapped, already reaching for my bottle. A chorus of groans and protests greeted my attempt to rouse Titus, but the threat of a cold splash did the trick.
Scrambling out of their bunks, the two fools stumbled about, gathering their belongings in a frenzy of movement. Helmets were slammed on heads, wiping away the last ribbons of sleep. Breastplates were done haphazardly, straps tangled and buckles on wrong spots. The peace of morning slumber was shattered by the sounds of hurried preparations, the clinking of metal, frustrated mutterings and the rhythmic thwack of Lucius' wet rag slapping Titus' still sleepy face.
Breakfast was a rushed affair, fueled by nervous anticipation and the promise of new information. Hardtack, usually followed by loud grumbling, was devoured with surprising haste. Bellies barely full, we followed the throngs of soldiers out of the ship and into the harbor, strolling along the pier and into an open field. 
Here, dozens stood assembled in rows of neat squares, forming a greater row and organized by ship with each row presumably consisting of 100 men sat side-by-side. In front of every cohort stood a stage where Gaius and a couple high-ranks stood.
A shared look of apprehension passed between us. We were about to learn the details of our mission, a mission the entire fleet stood oblivious to, shrouded in secrecy with whispers of a new world being the only clue for everyone else. The sheer weight of being newcomers in an entirely new legion settled heavily on our shoulders as we marched towards the center of the field, the murmur of thousands of soldiers a low, anxious hum in the clear morning air.
As the entirety of the ship strolled to their location, the familiar faces of our cabin mates strolled and suddenly halted and organized themselves into a square-ish formation with all of us following suit, forming our little square wich so happen to be smack-dab in front of our commanding officer, Gaius, face crossed with a stern look we need more time to get accustomed to.
Our commanding officer, after scanning the entirety of 600 men raised his hand with the other following suit, halfway stretched, signaling to quiet-down. Within one hand-gesture, the whole fleet slowly fell silent, ready to take-in their new campaign.
The commanding officer stood back, giving way for Gaius, the man the myth the legend. The officers in the other ship-group had already started to debrief their men, a mere muttering from the sheer distance between us.
"Brave soldiers! The senate had sent hundreds of men from the far away legion XII to new lands west" Gaius commanded, Jolting the majority of the half-asleep men. 
"From the infinite ocean, beyond the horizon, a few men had brought news of a groundbreaking discovery!" Gaius paused, quickly glancing at all of our faces, and with one breath, continued his booming speech. "beyond the great sea, beyond the great infinite, these brave souls had found themselves stranded on a new land, new uncivilized lands"
Gaius' voice boomed across the assembled legionnaires, shattering the morning calm like a thunderbolt. 
"Sinae?!" one soldier shrieked, the single word a strangled cry echoing in the sudden silence. Even among presumably hardened veterans, faces contorted in disbelief. 
"Hold your tongues, fools!" Gaius roared, his voice threatening to drown out the murmurs of dissent. "These lands are not the fabled Sinae! This is a world of savages, a barbaric horde who have spilled the blood of our brothers, our kind!"
The announcement slammed into the legionnaires like a battering ram, shattering their illusions. 
"All this training," a soldier muttered, his voice speaking volumes of terror. "All this preparation...for this!?"
Gaius didn't miss the tremor of fear. "Fear not, soldiers!" his voice regained its authoritative tone. "The very purpose of these preparations, this ironclad fleet, was for this very moment! We go not for trade, but for vengeance! This is a war of liberation, a righteous campaign to cleanse these savage lands of their filth!"
He then unveiled a weathered scroll, a priceless relic gifted from the new world force. There, the navigation guide lays in his arms, the distinctly yellow tint and discolored paper so painstakingly pieced together by the initial Roman force. With a flourish, he handed it to one of his lieutenants. "The path is clear," Gaius declared, his gaze sweeping across the eager and apprehensive faces. "Follow the guide, and victory shall be ours!"
A stunned silence filled the men for a moment, thick enough to choke on. Then, a ripple of disbelief stirred the crowd, quickly blossoming into a tide of muttered curses and sardonic laughter. Was this some bizarre prank, a cruel joke the senate were playing on the legionnaires? Surely, Gaius hadn't just declared a westward voyage across a seemingly endless ocean!... naively said everybody else, completely oblivious to the mission they were so keen in mocking.
"Westward?" one grumbled, his voice laden with disbelief. "Are we to sail off the edge of the world, then? Perhaps we'll hitch a ride on a giant sea turtle!" His words were met with a smattering of nervous laughter, a desperate attempt to lighten the absurdity of the situation.
"Maybe they finally found mermaids," another chimed in, his voice laced with a bitter humor. "Heard they have a fondness for Roman men." Jokes flew by the dozens and fast, a shield against the rising tide of apprehension. But amidst the cacophony, a few faces remained grim with a deep concern. 
Now, I watched as my comrades dismissed the mission as a drunken fantasy, flickering a bitter, yet fresh memory. Unlike these men, still blissfully ignorant, I knew the truth. This westward voyage was no fantasy, no whimsical adventure. It was a desperate gamble, a last stand against the creeping darkness that threatened to swallow the empire whole. A heavy sigh escaped among some of the men I knew, a sound lost in the mocking symphony of disbelief. I glanced at my crew, faced grim reflections of my own dawning realization. Us, at least, had understood the gravity of the situation. While the others drowned their anxieties in sarcastic noises, the weight of the unknown was already a crushing burden on our hearts. 
Gaius, oblivious to the undercurrent of disbelief and mounting fear, surveyed the scene with a stoic expression. He would address their concerns later, once the initial shock had worn off. For now, his focus remained on the task at hand, preparing his fleet for a voyage unlike any they had ever undertaken.
Sensing the disquiet, Gaius raised a hand, silencing the rising tide of whispers. "We set sail at noon," he declared, his voice cutting through the tension. "Prepare yourselves for a harsh voyage. The men who returned spoke of relentless storms, trials by wind and water!"
His words were a grim reminder of the horrors to come. The debriefing dissolved, the legionnaires dispersing like scattered leaves in a windy day. Some flocked to the familiar atmosphere of their ships, others drifted towards the bustling city for a last taste of normalcy before the inevitable. 
I cast a sideways glance at my crew, faces reflecting a grim understanding unlike the others still drowning in disbelief. We saw the truth beneath the surface first-hand. We had seen the maps, cryptic symbols hinting at uncharted lands, whispers of monstrous beasts guarding forgotten riches. But most importantly, we had seen the toll this mission had already taken, the haunted eyes of scouts returning early, the hushed pronouncements of dwindling supplies, the ever-present fear that this "new world" might not be the paradise we desperately needed it to be. We had a taste of the truth, something bitter that left a metallic aftertaste on our tongues.
The rest of the fleet however, remained blissfully ignorant. Their initial disbelief had morphed into a strange, infectious optimism. It was like watching myself a few months ago, the same naive hope that had burned brightly before being brutally stomped in the face of harsh reality.
Titus, with a heavy sigh, lumbered toward our assigned ship, the rest of the crew following suit. The climb aboard was a familiar routine, muscle memory taking over as we navigated the creaking decks. Finally reaching the hallway leading to our shared cabin, Lucius barged in majestically, the door slamming against the wooden walls with a force that rattled the very timbers. This time, however, his dramatic entrance didn't interrupt a half-finished poker game and glances from our cabin mates.
As we piled in, tossing our packs and gear onto the bunks with a carelessness born from exhaustion. The clatter of metal and thudding of boots echoing in the cramped space as I flung my pack onto the floor. After letting out a sigh that mirrored the one that had escaped Titus moments ago, I reached for the straps of my chestplate, the metal chestplate dropping to the floor with more of a thud than a clang. It was a welcome release nonetheless, the worn leather tunic beneath feeling like a second skin compared to the shifting constrict of the armor.
The rest of the crew followed suit, stripping off their armor with practiced ease. The cabin quickly filled with the clatter of metal and the soft sighs of men finally allowing themselves to relax. They swan-dived on their bunks, seeking peace in the familiar camaraderie. But even amongst our close brotherhood, a heavy silence settled, punctuated only by the rhythmic creak of the ship as it rocked gently in the harbor. It was a tangible silence, thick with unspoken anxieties and the looming shadow of the future that lay ahead.
The distant sounds of activity on deck grew steadily louder, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of boots and the shouts of legionnaires. Soon, the floorboards vibrated beneath our feet, a tremor that signaled the arrival of our fellow passengers. With a groan, I rose from my bunk, curiosity fueled by the sudden burst of noise.
Pushing open the cabin door, I was met with a scene unlike any I'd witnessed before. The once-empty hallway was now teeming with legionnaires, their faces a mixture of nervous excitement and hesitant hope. As I pressed myself against the wall to avoid the throng, I couldn't help but overhear snippets of conversation that drifted through the air.
"Westward, eh?" a voice boomed, words just brimming with skepticism. "Never even been west of the market square, let alone the edge of the world."
"When will you be a glass half-full kind of guy for once!? Aelius!" came a younger voice. "They wouldn't send us on a suicide mission would they? There must be something out there, new lands filled with riches and glory!"
An old soldier chuckled dryly. "Riches and glory eh? More like rocks and sand lad. at least it's a change of scenery right? Besides, I heard the grain prices are skyrocketing back home. New land means new food so this might not be a lost cause"
Grain prices. The words sent a jolt of curiosity down my spine. Do the whispers of empty granaries and frozen aqueducts hold a terrible truth? I'd seen the long lines outside bakeries, especially back in totally affordable Rome, the desperate eyes of families clutching empty sacks, ridiculous prices and slightly off coins.
"Aye," another voice chimed in, his tone laced with bitterness. "Heard they're rationing bread now. Two loaves a week for a family of four! What are we supposed to do, eat sand?"
The comment was met with a smattering of nervous laughter, a hollow sound that did little to mask the underlying fear. This westward mission wasn't just about finding new lands; it was a desperate gamble to find a solution to the very real threat of starvation and maybe… just maybe… more.
As the first ropes were loosed. The sailors scurried across the decks, hauling lines and adjusting sails. A chorus of grunts and shouts filled the air as the massive vessel strained against the waters, the groan of timbers a testament to its immeasurable size. 
I, on the other hand, a silent observer amidst the organized chaos, leaned against the railing on the top deck. My gaze was fixed on the shrinking harbor, watching the familiar landmarks shrink with every agonizingly slow pull of the sails. Homesickness began to start its ruthless jab at me, a stark contrast to the carefree optimism of the legionnaires around him.
Suddenly, a flicker of movement caught my eye. Gaius, deep in conversation with a young sailor, a weathered map clutched in their hands. The sailor, his brow furrowed in concentration, listened intently as Gaius pointed at various markings. After a sharp nod of understanding, the sailor scurried off to relay instructions to his crew.
Gaius, sensing my tiny presence, turned and approached me. With a small smile flickering across his lips. "Taking in the view, Marcus?"
"yep," I replied, my voice gruff. "Seems like a long way from Rome."
"Sure is genius," Gaius agreed, his eyes scanning the nearby ships and the shrinking harbor. "A necessary journey nonetheless. News has begun spreading around the initial party that they've encountered some… unexpected currents out west."
He paused, his voice dropping to a low murmur. "Uncharted territory never fails to surprise, Marcus. Be prepared for anything."
I met his gaze steadily. "We'll be ready sir. We always are."
A flicker of appreciation passed through Gaius' eyes. "Good. Remember, Marcus, this mission is bigger than any of us. It's about the empire, the people. Keep that fire alive in the hearts of your comrade, even when things get tough."
With a final nod, Gaius clapped me on the shoulder and made his way back below deck. Left alone, I watched him go. A heavy weight settled in my gut, a weight that transcended the physical armor I recently shed. I knew the hardships that awaited, the unforgiving jungle, the beasts and the ever-present threat of dwindling supplies. I also knew the truth Gaius had chosen to hold back from the legionnaires, we hadn't just encountered unexpected currents. Tales of a land that seemed to defy logic itself. But that was a burden I would shoulder alone, for now.
As the sun started to approach the horizon, the ship lurched forward. The rhythmic creak of the timbers became the new constant, a lullaby for a journey into the unknown. The harbor lights, once bright beacons of familiarity, winked out of existence entirely. We were adrift now, a lone vessel on a vast ocean, sailing towards a bleak future. Regardless, we were now a whole army, a whole fleet, fighting, moving, sleeping and eating as one. We would traverse through the darkness together, face whatever challenges awaits together and get pelted by arrows together.

Chapter XI

Days had bled into each other, a monotonous cycle of sun and spray. The ocean stretched before us, a thick slab of blue with the endless expanse of water on the side. But today, a disquiet settled over the normally carefree crew. A smear of black clouds stained the horizon, a harbinger of something far more sinister than a passing squall.
Panic jolted throughout my body. Memories of the vicious storm we'd endured months ago, the one that splintered our mast and left us on our last limb for days, flashed behind my eyelids. I couldn't bear the thought of facing another one, I couldn't bear the thoughts of terrorizing fresh brains to the terror, especially so far from land.
Ignoring the solid hierarchy, I bolted towards the nearest group of sailors, their laughter harsh against the growing tension. "Storm's coming!" I blurted, the urgency in my voice a stark contrast to their carefree demeanor.
The lead sailor, a wiry man with a perpetually sunburned face, barely glanced at me. "Local storm, a squall if you will," he scoffed. "We've weathered worse boy. Back to your post!"
Disbelief bubbled in my chest. Weren't they seeing the same ominous clouds? Didn't they feel the oppressive stillness in the air? Frustration gnawed at me, a helpless bystander in a brewing disaster.
With a growl of irritation, I stormed back to my cabin. My crew, sprawled on their bunks in various states of consciousness, looked up at my agitated entrance. "Storm's brewing," I announced, my voice laced with urgency. "Big one."
"Bold of you to steal my job in ruthlessly wrecking the cabin door Marcus…" Lucius greeted, his cookiecutter tactic to lighten-up moods had aged like lightning, a fancy way to say it doesn't work anymore.
The other side of our cabin meanwhile, looked with annoyance, glaring at me with the eyes effectively spelling out "was that necessary?" rather than a "are you sure?". 
But unlike the sailors, they didn't scoff. They didn't even bother looking a second time, ignoring the atmosphere. Titus met my gaze with a grim nod. "I saw the clouds, Marcus. Nasty looking."
A tense silence descended. We all knew what this kind of storm meant, dwindling rations at a faster rate, the ever-present threat of leaks, the constant battle against the waves. There was no point in voicing our fears. We, veterans of the first storm knew what to expect.
"Batten down the hatches then," Lucius finally said, his voice strained. "We'll weather it together, like before."
The decision was made. No panicked scrambling, no headless chickens running around on deck. We'd face it head-on, the way we had done all those weeks ago.
The storm arrived with a suddenness that stole our breath. Rain lashed down in icy sheets, the roar of the wind drowning out all other sounds. From our cabin, we could hear the terrified shouts of men, both inside and outside. The frantic scrambling of feet on deck, the splintering of wood as something gave way, the sickening crash of waves against the hull and the bolts of lightning booming overhead. A symphony of destruction unfolding a plank of wood overhead.
A loud crack suddenly rang through the cabin, followed by a torrent of seawater pouring through a newly sprung leak. Titus cursed under his breath, scrambling to plug the hole with whatever he could find, somebody's tunic, a spoon, rags, it doesn't matter.
Through the chaos, I couldn't help but steal a glance at the other men in our cabin, huddled across from us. Their faces were ashen, eyes wide with terror and hands clenching to the bunk-frames. Compared to the relatively calm expressions of my own crew, they looked like caught rabbits.
"Looks like someone forgot their sea legs," I rumbled, a hint of amusement lacing my voice.
Silence. Not a single whimper or retort rose from the other side. Just a collective flinch as another bolt of lightning boomed overhead.
"Maybe you city slickers should've stuck to paving roads," Lucius chimed in, a smirk playing on his lips. Still, no response. Just the frantic hammering of their hearts echoing in the tense silence.
The leak worsened, a steady stream of water pouring through the gap in the hull. Panic then filled their eyes, a stark contrast to the grim determination in their faces days ago. We knew the storm's fury and had weathered its wrath before, these fresh-faced recruits however, were a different story.
"Don't worry, lads," I said, my voice dripping with mocking sympathy, "water never hurts anyone. Right, fellas?"
My crew chuckled grimly, the sound a stark contrast to the terrified silence from the other side. The leak worsened, the water gushing-in onto the cabin floor, making a miniature replica of the ocean just beyond the hulls. The new recruits huddled closer, their eyes wide with a mix of terror and resentment.
"For Jupiter's almighty sake! HELP ME KEEP THIS PLACE DRY! MARCUS, LUCIUS, COME ON!" Titus roared, tired and exhausted from his efforts in keeping the whole ship afloat.
The playful banter died in my throat, replaced by a sense of grim satisfaction. The sailors might have scoffed at my warnings earlier, but the storm was a harsh teacher, and it seemed like they were finally getting their first lesson. There would be time for taunts later, for now, survival was the only thing that mattered.
Scrambling across the cabin, we joined Titus at the ever-widening gash. Salt spray stung our eyes as the relentless waves battered the ship, threatening to explode the makeshift patch. Titus shoved a bucket filled with rags and sailcloth scraps into our arms.
"Stuff it in, anything! We need to buy some time before the next wave hits!"
We worked in a desperate frenzy, shoving damp fabric into the gaping hole, the icy sea water soaking us to the bone. The reeking stench of saltwater and fear filled the air, blending with the rhythmic groaning of the tormented ship. Every wave, every crash, every boom from the outside threatens to overpower our efforts, sending a new fresh torrent of water into the already soaked cabin.
Hours bled into a seemingly endless night. The storm, a relentless god with an insatiable hunger for destruction, showed no signs of relenting. Sleep was a distant luxury, replaced by the constant, bone-deep cold and the never-ending battle against the encroaching sea. The new recruits, their shell of bravery long cracked by the storm's fury, huddled in a shivering mass, their faces pale and drawn. Even their occasional whimpers were swallowed by the storm's deafening roar.
Finally, as dawn approached, a sliver of hope peeked through the storm-filled sky. The relentless pounding of the waves seemed to diminish ever so slightly. With ragged breaths and aching limbs, we stumbled back, surveying the scene with weary eyes. The leak had slowed to a trickle, a testament to our desperate struggle. The storm, though far from dissipating, seemed to have lost some of its earlier rage.
But the victory, if it could be called such, was a hollow one. The once-proud ship lay battered and bruised, its sails shredded, its main mast a testament to the storm's fury. The deck was a tangled mess of debris, the once-polished wood now scarred and splintered. It would take days, weeks perhaps, to make the ship even remotely seaworthy again.
A week passed. Though the storm had finally passed, leaving behind a bruised and battered sky, the work continued. We toiled under the relentless sun, repairing sails, splicing lines, and replacing broken spars. The camaraderie forged in the crucible of the storm deepened into a bond born of shared hardship. Even the new recruits, their fear replaced by a newfound respect, joined in the grueling work with determination born of desperation to see this journey through.
As we worked side-by-side, veterans and rookies alike, one evening, as the sun continued its journey below the horizon, the sky followed suit with fiery hues of orange and red dominating the sky, a group of young recruits, their faces illuminated by the dying light. And their voices carried on the salty breeze.
"Do you think… Do you think anyone is left in this supposed land we're heading to?" a young man nervously asked.
"Of course there is!" another chimed-in. "How do you think they survive the bloodbath that is Germania?" he beamed, turning his hopeful gaze towards me.
The enthusiasm was infectious, a stark contrast to the weary atmosphere that had begun to creep into the hearts of some of my crew, especially Lucius. I forced a smile, the image of Gaius' grim expression flashing through my mind.
"We'll find out soon enough," I rumbled, trying to inject some of his optimism into my voice. "The sooner we get this ship fixed, the sooner we can reach this… new world… and find out what awaits us there."
"A new world!" another young man chimed in, his eyes shining with a fantastical light. "Imagine it! Uncharted lands teeming with resources ripe for the taking! We'll be heroes! bringing hope back to the Empire!"
Their naivete was both endearing and unsettling. They spoke of this new world with the same wide-eyed wonder one might describe a fabled Sinae, overflowing with riches and opportunity, just as we had. Me, along with my crew, knew better. We knew the blood-soaked earth, a broken colony clinging to its last strands of life, a stark contrast to the prosperous new frontier we had envisioned. But for now, we kept those whispers to ourselves, unwilling to crush the flickering flame of hope that burned so brightly in these young recruits. The future ahead would be nothing but soul-crushing to these boys, just as it had been for us. We would need all the optimism we could muster to face the natives or whatever else awaited on the shores of the new world, a burden we now shared with these fresh-faced soldiers, so full of hope, so blissfully unaware of the harsh reality that awaited them.
A week had crawled by, each sunrise a hard-won victory. The relentless sun beat down on our backs as we toiled, sweat stinging our eyes and leaving salt tracks on faces. The once-proud vessel was slowly transforming back into something familiar, a survivor, scarred and battered.
I ran a hand across a freshly patched section of hull, the rough wood a stark contrast to the smooth, polished planks it had once been. The storm, a relentless leviathan, had carved its fury into the very bones of the ship. Deep gashes, hastily sealed with a patchwork of scavenged wood, scarred its once pristine surface. The once-majestic masts, now held upright by a web of knotted ropes, twisted and weathered.
Everywhere I looked, I saw the echoes of the ship I called home once, the vessel that had carried me to face judgment in Rome, a ship that had already seen its share of storms and battles, now mirrored the state of this one. It was a chilling reminder that the sea, for all its majesty, held no mercy. It would break a pristine ship just as easily as it would wear down a seasoned one. We were all just playthings in its grasp.
The youthful enthusiasm of the new recruits, so similar to our own excitement months ago, served as a bittersweet reminder. Their faces, once etched with determination, now only hold a glimmer of hope, a belief in the promise of this new world. A promise I, and my weary crew, knew better than to indulge in. The harsh reality of the colony, the truth, was whispered by the winds afterall.
As I pondered the endless possibilities of our corades, leaning against the railing, I spotted something oh so familiar, yet chilling. The vaguely familiar smudge of gray on the horizon that stretched endlessly for miles on both sides. The same outline and everything.
"Cant be…" I grumbled, hoping my eyes were malfunctioning.
Lucius materialized beside me, a sardonic twist to his lips. "Well, looks like our vacation is over, Marcus," he muttered. We exchanged a grim glance, the weight of our shared knowledge a heavy burden.
"Land… land!" I cried, my voice dashing through the ship and even through the thick doors.
Disbelief flickered across the men's faces, disbelief gave way to a gasp, the sound ripped through the oppressive silence like thunder. Eyes strained towards the horizon, searching for any sign, any confirmation of this impossible salvation. 
"Land?" a voice muttered, spitting a stream of tobacco juice overboard. "What's next? Unicorns? Keep dreaming boy!"
The audacity of the remark sent a fresh wave of irritation through me. I distinctly remembered uttering something very similar, almost word for word, on our own voyage months ago. Back then, the world had been full of possibilities, a treasure chest waiting to be plundered. Now, I know better.
A tense silence followed, broken only by the rhythmic creaking of the ship. The crew exchanged uneasy glances, the comment was like a heavy blow of ignorance and quick-thinking.
Regardless, everybody slowly continued with their daily routine, tending the ship, hauling crates, hammering boards and sweeping the deck, an aura of disturbance crossed everyone's faces, trying to forget about such promises and move on, yet the possibility of salvation still clung by the skin of the teeth on their minds. Still, pessimism reigns, infecting the minds of many.
Then, a shout ripped across the waves, a lookout from another ship confirming the sighting. "Land?" The word rang, barely audible, yet heavy with hope that mirrored our own journey weeks ago.
Slowly, doubt gave way to a flicker of excitement. More and more crew members scanned the horizon, their eyes widening as they confirmed the sighting. The faint sliver of gray morphed into a definite line, a jagged edge to the world.
The fleet then erupted in a collective cheer, a sound so raw it split the blue sky in half, shattering the oppressive silence and replacing it with torrents of shouts and hollers. Land. Salvation. A new beginning. 
The fleet, a battered collection of vessels, lurched forward, drawn towards the jewel on the horizon. The promise of new land had ignited a spark of hope within them, a fire that burned bright despite our weary cynicism.
Yet, amidst the cheers and shouts, Lucius' words lingered in my mind, a grim reminder of the truth that awaited us. "Vacation's over," he had said. And he was right. The real test was about to begin. But unlike them, I wasn't filled with naive hope. I had seen the truth behind the veil, it was a bitter pill to swallow, but it was better than jars of sweet lies.

Chapter XII

The smudge on the horizon slowly morphed into a jagged coastline, a sight that should have ignited a spark of joy within. Instead, a cold dread settled in the pit of my stomach. We had arrived.
The cheers that erupted from the new recruits were like echoes from a forgotten past, a stark reminder of our own naive optimism all those weeks ago. Now, seasoned by hardship and disillusionment, I saw only a reflection of the wrecked hopes that awaited.
As we drew closer, a new detail emerged, a cluster of ships docked haphazardly along the shore. Relief flooded Gaius' face, a beacon of hope in the growing gloom. "Look Marcus! The first fleet must have made harbor already!"
Gaius's assumptions were almost comedic by me, and as we inched closer, Gaius's face of relief morphed into a chilling realization. The docked ships had no welcoming fleet. They were broken hulks, their masts snapped like twigs, their paint peeling like sunburn skin. Debris and canoes littered the shoreline, their position unchanged ever since my and along with two others had landed.
Even the ever-pragmatis Titus couldn't mask the tremor in his voice. "Gods be damned," he muttered, "Nothing much really changed since we arrived…"
A heavy silence descended upon us, broken only by the rhythmic creaking of our own ship. Even the somewhat optimistic shouts from the new recruits had died down, replaced by a palpable sense of unease.
My stomach churned. Had the entire colony been wiped out? The thought was almost too horrifying to think.
Titus, ever the pragmatist, cleared his throat. "There has to be survivors," he said, his voice firm despite the tremor that ran through it. "One or more forts must still be standing."
His words were a lifeline, a sliver of hope amidst the encroaching despair. With a renewed determination, we steered the ship towards a somewhat wider shore, the wreckage serving as a grim warning of the dangers to the fresh-faced men.
The anchor splashed into the water a good two hundred paces from the shore, a cautious distance dictated by the unsettling welcome we'd received. Chaos erupted as the new recruits, their initial excitement replaced by nervous energy, scrambled to disembark. We, the veterans, maintained a semblance of order, holding the eager throng towards the beach.
The urgency to reach the shore scratched at me. I couldn't wait for the slow process of disembarking everyone. "We need to get to any fort, now," I barked, grabbing my armor and throwing it on over my sweat-drenched clothes. Every second wasted felt like a decade down the drain.
Titus and Gaius exchanged a worried glance, but there was no time for arguments. They followed suit, hurriedly pulling on their own armor as I shoved a bulging pack into the small raft we'd secured.
With a grunt, I clambered into the raft, Titus and Gaius close behind. A quick shove sent us bobbing away from the larger ship. As we cut through the water, I cast a glance back at the scene of controlled chaos. The remaining crew were lowering smaller boats, shouts and instructions echoing across the water. The image mirrored my own hurried departure all those weeks ago, but this time, the destination held no promise of a bright future.
"Marcus is right," Titus rumbled, his voice hoarse. "Fort Aquila would be the first pick. It's the sturdiest structure in the entire colony, and the most likely place to find survivors."
"Fort Aquila… I thought that the fort almost crumbled!?" I interjected, Titus seemingly sensed the burning questions within. 
"Ever since, the higher ups decided to make Aquila a last resort, being the closest to a river. Explicit order I'm not supposed to tell you guys, only other centurions."
Gaius, ever the scholar, furrowed his brow. "Fort Aquila? I don't remember that name being mentioned in any of the Imperial records."
"There's a good reason for that," Titus replied, "Fort Aquila was never meant for Imperial eyes. It was a hastily-patched fort built to withstand the worst the new world could throw at us."
Gaius' confusion was etched on his face. "The worst? What kind of situation are we talking about here?"
Titus hesitated, then let out a ragged sigh. "Let's just say we underestimated the challenges we'd face here. The natives are fierce, the environment unforgiving, and… well, there are other things too. Things I wouldn't recommend discussing in polite company."
Gaius' youthful bravado, though slightly dented by Titus' cryptic warnings, still shone through. "Sounds like a few bumps in the road, that's all. I've faced worse with less. The Imperial Legion is unmatched! We'll get this colony back on its feet in no time, and then some more!"
Titus snorted, a humorless sound that did little to hide his growing concern. "Don't underestimate these 'bumps' Gaius. They've broken seasoned soldiers. But you're right, we have a strong force. We just need to be… adaptable. Approach things with an open mind, and be prepared to improvise."
"Adapt, Improvise" Gaius scoffed, a hint of amusement creeping into his voice. "We Romans do that best, right Marcus?"
I grunted in reply, my gaze fixed on the approaching shoreline. Titus' words echoed in my ears, a stark contrast to Gaius' unwavering confidence. We were about to face a reality far harsher than anything we'd ever encountered, a reality that might shatter the giant's illusions entirely.
The beach loomed closer, the debris on the shore now visible in horrifying detail, snapped weapons, dented armor, and tattered flags, all testament to a desperate struggle. A cold dread froze my insides, a feeling I couldn't quite shake. I would be surprised if I find fresh footprints. The mighty Roman legion might not be enough.
Water surged against the hull of the raft, spitting spray as we grappled for the shore. With a final grunt, we beached the small vessel, scrambling onto the sand with urgency.
Behind us, the main fleet was a buzz of activity. Ships lowered smaller boats, letting out a steady stream of men and stuff onto the beach. It was a scene mirrored my own arrival all those months ago.
Gaius, ever the eager leader, shouldered his pack and turned to us, his youthful face flushed with determination. "Come on! We waste no time. Fort Aquila awaits!"
He barked out orders, directing the handful of men who had landed with us to fall in line behind him and Titus. There were no cheers, no celebratory shouts, just a grim silence punctuated by the rhythmic crunch of boots on sand.
As we marched inland, the weight of the wrecked ships and the debris-littered shore pressed down on me. Gaius, however, seemed oblivious. He paced confidently ahead, his gaze fixed on the surrounding trees unlike anything him and his fleet had ever seen before.
"This place is… alien, you sure this isn't a new plane of existence we just stumbled onto?" he declared, his voice echoing in the oppressive silence. "Not like it's a problem… We'll have these guys back on their feet in no time! Imagine the spoils, the glory!"
Titus, walking beside me, let out a humorless chuckle. "Spoils and glory eh? Perhaps. But remember, these colonists weren't idle fools. They built Fort Aquilla for a reason. Something here is threatening enough to warrant such a fortification."
"All the more reason to show them the might of the Legion!" Gaius boomed, his voice brimming with unwavering confidence. "We've faced hordes back in northern africa, what could these lands possibly have that we can't handle?"
Titus shook his head, a flicker of sadness in his eyes. "Don't underestimate what you don't understand, Gaius. These colonists have been here for an eternity. They've learned the harsh realities of this new world in a way we can only imagine."
"We'll learn quickly enough," Gaius retorted, his bravado unwavering. "The Legion adapts, Titus. That's what makes us the best army in the world!"
I remained silent, watching the exchange with a heavy heart. Gaius' optimism was admirable, but I feared it was misplaced. The wreckage on the shore should whisper a grim story, yet the story fell on deaf ears. This new world held dangers far beyond anything Rome had encountered before, dangers that might test the very limits of the Legion's awed adaptability.
The trek towards Fort Aquilla stretched on, the silence broken only by the crunch of footsteps and the occasional cry of a startled bird and a roar of something else… still unknown to me. With each step, the weight of the unknown grew heavier. Gaius' optimistic tone was hollow in my ears, a stark contrast to the reality that was probably about to unfold within the walls of the fort.
Despite the atmosphere, Gaius remained undeterred. He pushed forward with vigor, his assurances of Roman might echoing through the alien trees. Titus, however, cast worried glances around in growing concern.
Finally, the trees thinned, revealing a sight that sent a jolt of horror through me. Fort Aquilla, the supposed bastion of civilization, lay in crumbling ruins. The thick walls were cracked and twisted, as if ravaged by some monstrous beasts. Crumbling towers leaned dangerously, their foundation missing chunks of stone. The massive wooden gates, once a symbol of might, hung by a single hinge, splintered and charred.
Gaius' bravado faltered for a moment, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his face. But before he could voice his shock, Titus surged forward with a roar.
"Open the gates!" he boomed, his voice echoing in the desolate courtyard. "Reinforcements from Rome! Open up!"
A tense silence followed, broken only by the wind through the shattered remains. Then, a figure emerged from the shadows of the broken gatehouse. A lone guard, his armor dented and dull, stared at us with hollow eyes. His face, streaked with grime and despair, crumpled in relief at the sight of the Roman standard gleaming in the air.
His trembling hands were barely able to manage the task, opening the gate before suddenly stopping halfway, only giving us barely enough space to squeeze through.
Gaius, his initial shock replaced by a surge of misplaced optimism, charged forward, shoving the gate open wider and pacing into the camp. "The reinforcements have arrived!"
The cheers that Gaius expected never came. The courtyard was deserted, save for a scattering of broken weapons, overturned carts, and pools of dried blood that stained the cracked flagstones.
The horrific state of Fort Aquilla sent a ripple of shock through the ranks. The initial collective gasp morphed into a low murmur of disbelief and dread. As the gate groaned open wider, revealing more and more of the desolate courtyard, a slow movement stirred within the shadows of the surrounding tents. Hesitant figures emerged from their makeshift shelters, eyeing us with relief and emptiness.
These weren't the glorious colonists Gaius had envisioned. These were broken survivors, eyes haunted by horrors beyond the mortal mind's comprehension. Battle-fatigue, the ever-present weight of the probably near-constant assaults on their only refuge had taken their toll on their armor, flesh and minds. Their armor, a motley collection of mismatched pieces, bore the scars of countless encounters. Some clutched makeshift weapons, their gazes flickering nervously between the newcomers and the shattered ramparts.
The sight of the Roman standard, however, sparked a flicker of hope in their hollow eyes. A ragged cheer, tinged with desperation, rose from the assembled crowd. It wasn't the joyous roar of a welcoming crowd, but the desperate plea of a people clinging to the last strands of hope.
Gaius, faced with the grim reality before him, straightened his shoulders and raised a hand for silence. "We are the Legion!" he boomed, his voice echoing in the broken courtyard. "We are here to aid you, our brothers in-arms!"
His words were met with a smattering of applause, but the enthusiasm was muted. These people had seen promises broken before. They had seen hope turn to ash in their mouths. Yet, the arrival of these well-equipped soldiers offered a lifeline, a fragile hope that they clung to with weary desperation.
Unfortunately, the size of the fort posed a significant challenge. The sprawling fleet, while impressive, struggled to find accommodation within the confines of Fort Aquilla. Undeterred, Gaius barked out orders. "Expand the fort! Make room for everyone!"
With renewed purpose, his soldiers set to work. The clang of hammers and construction filled the air as they refortified the crumbling walls and erected makeshift shelters to house the overflow from the fleet.
Titus, ever the pragmatist, grabbed Gaius' shoulder and steered him towards a dilapidated command tent. "We need to assess the situation, Gaius," he said, his voice grim. "There's much to discuss."
Meanwhile, a yearning for the good ol' days, the days before endless battles and fear got me scanning the faces emerging from the tents, each one a haunted mask reflecting the horrors they'd seen. Then, a flicker of recognition. There, by a banner tattered like a widow veil, huddled a familiar figure – Aulus, the one and only.
Relief, sweet relief flooded my system. I practically vaulted towards the tent, picturing a joyous reunion that would echo through the ages. But as I flung aside the makeshift door with the grace of a drunken elephant, the warmth in my chest died a quicker death than a fish caught in a spear.
The once-familiar tent, now crammed with extra bodies, held only strangers. Their faces, like weathered tombstones, stared back with a mix of weary suspicion and the kind of fear that only comes from staring into the abyss. The only familiar sight of one man, Aulus, with eyes, once bright with the fire of a thousand campaigns, were now hollowed-out caverns, reflecting only the emptiness that echoed in his soul.
"W-what…" I mumbled, face locked into the messy tent and the strangers in the tent.
"Welcome back, Marcus"Aulus interjected, cutting me off mid-sentence. "What's wrong?" he asked
"Who are these guys!? And… where's everybody else??" I blurted, voice filled with panic and concern.
"These guys are from another tent, we were sharing this tent since everybody else had…" Aulus stopped, before letting out a sigh. Even though no more words came out of his mouth, it's obvious where they had went to.
"Had…" I continued, pushing Aulus to complete his sentence, but as I looked at Aulus, his face still reflected the empty void that is his soul.
The camaraderie, the shared laughter around the campfire, the shoulder-to-shoulder battles… all but a distant memory. The horrors Aulus must've faced here had carved a chasm between us wider than a canyon.
I swallowed a lump the size of a mountain, loneliness crashing over like a rogue wave. This wasn't the homecoming I'd envisioned. This was a new reality, a harsh one that cracked not just at the fort's crumbling walls, but at the very soul of the men who dared to resist.

Chapter XIII

Inside the cramped tent, a single flickering oil lamp cast long shadows that danced on the walls. Huddled across from me sat Aulus, a ghost of the man I once knew. 
"Constant attacks, Marcus," Aulus rasped, "Day and night, those damned Xaltocans never let up. They wear us down, chip away at our defenses like termites on a rotten log."
"Xaltocans? Who exactly are we talking about here?" I interrupted, instead of facing the face of annoyance I'd expect, Aulus looked at me with a blank slate of a face. Unchanged since I arrived.
"We heard the call 'Xaltoca' during attacks, that call, unchanging in every battle" he paused for a moment, "we all just… assumed its the tribe's name"
He then gestured weakly at a pile of presumably rations on a makeshift table, a crust of bread, a handful of discolored vegetables, and a single, scrawny rat on a skewer. "Food's running low. We've resorted to… unconventional means to keep our bellies from rumbling."
Unconventional sources… My mind started to conjure up horrifying images much to my dismay, men chewing on boiled leather or worse.
"And the five other centuries?" I pressed, my voice tight. "...any word?"
A humorless chuckle escaped Aulus' lips, a dry, rattling sound. "centuries? More like graveyards. One by one, forts fell while this one grew. And their defenders? Well, let's just say their suffering is finally over."
He recounted tales of desperate last stands, of valiant charges swallowed by a sea of obsidian blades, of screams echoing through the night as the barbaric peoples of this land breached the walls. He spoke of men driven to madness by starvation, of cannibalism whispered in the dead of night. With each horrifying story, the fire in my gut intensified, a white-hot inferno fueled by fury and the desperate need for vengeance.
"We're barely holding on here," Aulus continued, his voice cracking. "Just a matter of time before this one falls too. But at least… at least we'll take a few of those demons with us."
A cold resolve settled over me. These weren't just stories – they were a call to arms. These 'Xaltocans' had taken everything from these men, my comrades, their hope, even their sanity. 
I rose to my feet, the cramped tent suddenly stifling. "We won't kneel, Aulus," I declared, my voice ringing with newfound conviction. "The reinforcement has arrived. We will fight back. We will make those dogs pay for every life they've taken!"
A flicker of something akin to life sparked in Aulus' vacant eyes, a testament to the spirit that still remained somehow. "reinforcement, huh?" he rasped. "About time. Let's show them what Roman steel is made of, one last time."
Stepping out of the tent, I took a deep breath of the air. The atmosphere of the fort seemed to press down on me, a tangible weight of despair. But beneath it, righteous anger, a burning desire to carve a void through the barbaric native ranks.
A bellow erupted from the command tent, shattering the oppressive silence that had settled over Fort Aquila. Gaius, his face rife with newfound purpose, emerged from the makeshift headquarters, his armor gleaming like a beacon of hope in the doom and gloom.
"Soldiers!" he boomed, his voice echoing across the war-torn courtyard. "We have received word of an enemy fort, bountiful in resources ripe for the taking!"
A cheer rose from the assembled ranks, a sound that, while lacking the joyous fervor of untested troops, held a steely determination. The prospect of action, of striking back against the relentless onslaught, rekindled a spark of defiance in many eyes.
"This will be a lightning raid, a force of a couple hundred men will follow in this expedition, we move swiftly through the thick jungles up north, no entrenching equipment needed" Gaius continued, his voice laced with urgency. "The dense foliage would conceal us from any would-be attackers, gather intelligence on the fortress as best you can. Cohort one and two, step forward!"
I surged to the front of the forming ranks, my blood thrumming with a primal urge for battle. The stories of Aulus, the images of fallen comrades, fueled a fire of righteous fury within. I wouldn't just be fighting for another Fort, I would be fighting for my fallen contubernium, for every life snuffed out by these barbaric 'Xaltocans'.
Gaius' gaze swept over the assembled men, landing on me. A flicker of recognition crossed his youthful face. "Marcus! Great to see you ready! You and your cabin will be part of the advance guard. We need you guys to carve a path through the Xaltocan lines in a potential encounter!"
I thumped my chest in salute, "We will live up to expectation sir!"
With renewed purpose, I dashed back to the cramped tent. Throwing on my armor, the familiar weight grounding me, I grabbed my gladius and pilum, the polished metal glinting with a deadly promise.
Aulus, who had shuffled out of his own tent, watched me with a mixture of envy and trepidation. "Going to carve yourself some trophies are you, Marcus?" he rasped, a hint of his old humor flickering in his voice.
I met his gaze, my own burning with a dark intensity. "More than trophies, Aulus," I vowed, my voice low. "This is for our fallen brothers. This is for vengeance!"
Aulus' smile faltered, replaced by a weary understanding. He placed a gaunt hand on my shoulder, the touch surprisingly strong. "Be careful, friend," he whispered. "Those Xaltocans are… different. They fight with a ferocity unlike anything we've faced before."
With a final, grim nod to Aulus, I turned and strode out of the tent, heart pounding, a war drum in my chest. I was a soldier, the Xaltocans were about to learn a very valuable lesson, never underestimate the fury of a cornered legionnaire.
The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the war-torn courtyard of Fort Aquila. Gaius strode with the assembled troops. A hush fell over the gathered men as Gaius approached our makeshift line. My cabin, a motley crew of weary veterans and fresh-faced legionnaires with curious eyes, stood in front, ready to face whatever horrors awaited us in the depths of these jungles.
These new recruits, bless their naive optimism, had no idea what awaited them in this strange new world. The creatures, the natives, even the flora were formidable enough.
Gaius raised a hand, silencing the murmurs. His voice, though youthful, held an air of command as he spoke. "Remember, men," he boomed, his words echoing across the courtyard, "we are the Romans! We have faced down barbarian hordes, bloodthirsty bandits, and even those pesky burburs back in north africa. These so-called 'Xaltocans' will be no different!"
A cheer then erupted from the ranks, a mix of genuine enthusiasm and nervous bravado. Whether they truly believed Gaius' words or not, it was the only solace we had. With a final bellow of command, Gaius raised his sword, the polished metal flashing in the fading sunlight. We surged forward, a wave of humanity flowing out of the relative safety of Fort Aquila and into the waiting jaws of the unknown.
We marched at a steady pace, the weight of our armor and packs a familiar burden on my back. Ahead, Gaius and Titus walked side-by-side, their voices carrying back on the warm afternoon breeze. 
"Quite the oddity, isn't gaius supposed to be in his tent while we do all the work?" Lucius muttered, his remark seemed to mirror my and possibly hundreds of others.
"I don't know, he's probably going to be in the back of the line when we face-off" I replied, Lucius shrugged at the possibility though i wouldn't blame him, it's an unwritten rule that the centurions retreat behind us while we face-off against the enemy lines.
Gaius though, not hearing any of this commentary, peppered Titus with questions about the land, his curiosity still burning bright despite the situation, "So these Xaltocans, what are they like exactly?" Gaius asked, his voice laced with a hint of excitement. "Are they hulking barbarians or cunning tacticians?"
Titus sighed, a weary sound that seemed to echo my own fatigue. "They're… different," he replied, choosing his words carefully. "Initially, we had peaceful contact with them months ago. They were a curious people. We exchanged gifts, learned a little of their language."
A surprised whistle escaped Gaius' lips. "Peaceful contact? I wouldn't have expected that!"
"There's always diplomacy before conflict, Gaius," Titus said, a hint of bitterness in his voice. "But diplomacy has a hard time surviving greed."
"Greed? What do you mean?"
Titus' jaw clenched for a moment before he continued. "Some members of our initial army took it on themselves to fill their personal coffers. A few pilfered trinkets, others… well, others took things a bit further."
A flicker of understanding crossed Gaius' face. "Ah, plunder then. A little souvenir hunting never hurt anyone, right?"
Titus stopped short, his gaze fixed on Gaius. "Souvenir hunting? Gaius, they sacked villages and stole bags of grain! That's not 'souvenir hunting,' that's an outright act of war! Is it any wonder they reacted with such hostility?"
Gaius shrugged nonchalantly. "Come on Titus, a little taking here and there, it's the spoils of war, isn't it? How else do we keep the legions funded? Besides, you guys were tethering on the brink of starvation!"
I winced at Gaius' words. His youthful bravado, while admirable in a way, grated on me. Titus, however, simply shook his head in a disappointed manner.
"There's a difference, Gaius, between desperate acts and blatant theft," he said, his voice low and controlled. "We Romans have built our reputation on civility and Strength. Actions like those undermine that reputation. They paint us not as brave conquerors, but as petty barbarians ourselves."
Gaius opened his mouth to retort, but Titus cut him off with a raised hand. "Let's just say," he said, his voice weary, "that the actions of a few led to the suffering of many. That's the reality on the ground here, Gaius. Not tales of glorious conquest, but a harsh lesson in cause and effect."
We continued our march in a heavy silence. Gaius, for once, seemed lost in thought. The harsh reality of the situation, the weight of Titus' words, hung over us like a storm cloud. The Xaltocans weren't simply savages to be conquered; they were a cornered beast, driven to violence by the very people sent to establish peace. It was a sobering thought, a bitter pill to swallow on our way to war.
"That was the past" Gaius retorted, breaking the short-lived silence, "we can't do anything about it, the present speaks of bloodshed, we're not letting that go away would we?"
"Certainly not, but knowing is half the battle" Titus interjected, his remark a final nail in the conversation as a thick slab of silence descended from the heavens.
The relentless jungle slowly choked on itself, the thick canopy thinning to reveal a landscape less hostile, if not exactly welcoming. Sparse woods stretched before us, branches casting spidery shadows on the uneven ground. Then a flicker of movement, a ruffle in the distant bushes, caught the eye of a soldier nearby. A ripple of unease spread through the ranks, quickly escalating into a low murmur.
Gaius reacted instantly, his face hardening with suspicion. "Halt!" he barked, raising his fist while his voice rang through the trees. "Form defensive ranks! Shields up! Prepare for an attack!"
The practiced movements of a thousand men became a well-oiled machine. We all fell into formation with practiced ease, shields interlocking to create a wall of hardwood and iron. 
"Remember your training, lads!" Gaius barked over my shoulder to a fresh-faced recruit struggling with his pilum. "Don't be a hero, stay in formation!"
He mumbled a nervous acknowledgment, his eyes darting nervously through the trees. Beside me, Lucius chuckled, a dry rasp that betrayed his own tension.
"Green as spring grass, these newbies," he muttered. "Bet they're picturing some glorious charge straight out of a song."
I snorted. "Let's hope they don't in the first place. Aulus' stories about these Xaltocans still rattle my bones."
Lucius scoffed. "Your friend is all doom and gloom it seems. We have a million men, all fresh and with full bellies. Those Xaltocans don't stand a chance!"
His words held a feel that I couldn't entirely share. Aulus' haunted eyes and his tales of relentless assaults still lingered in my mind. But Lucius was right, our numbers were overwhelming, our morale bolstered by the recent arrival of fresh supplies. Perhaps the soldier was just letting fear get the better of him.
Gaius scanned the woods ahead, his brow furrowed in concentration. Unlike the open plains we were accustomed to fighting on back in Europe, this new world offered no expansive fields for maneuvers. Here, the dense vegetation choked the landscape, forcing us to navigate a maze of trees and undergrowth. It wasn't ideal terrain, but we were Legionnaires. We would adapt.
With a curt nod, Gaius raised his sword. "Forward! But cautiously! Keep your eyes peeled! We don't know what lies inside these woods!"
The army lurched forward, a cautious tide of steel pushing through the undergrowth. The silence was broken only by the rustle of leaves beneath our boots and the nervous chatter of the new recruits. Despite the bravery of some, we were all aware of these woods' secrets, and those secrets might very well be deadly.

Chapter XIV

Then, with a gut-wrenching suddenness, the silence shattered. A blood-curdling shriek erupted from the woods ahead, a sound that ripped through the stillness with its inhuman scream, the trees itself seemed to cry along with the noise, ringing and oscillating wildly, it seemingly resonated from the very air itself. It pulsed with a dark, otherworldly rhythm, a chant that spoke of ancient rituals and bloodthirsty gods. The nervous chatter amongst the fresh recruits died with a strangled gasp, replaced by a suffocating silence as fear coldly gripped their hearts.
As if the very trees held their breath, waiting for the inevitable, the leaves on the jungle canopy shivered, casting flickering shadows on the forest floor. Then came the rain. But not the rain of life-giving water, this was a rain of death. A hail of arrows, tipped with obsidian shards that gleamed in the sunlight, diving down from the heavens above down to us like a thousand needles. Shouts of surprise and pain erupted from the ranks as men were pelted relentlessly.
Shields slammed together with a resounding clang, forming a hastily-formed tortoise formation against the onslaught. Most of the arrows clattered harmlessly off the wood, the remaining few finding their mark with a sickening thud, lodging themselves deep in the shields, leaving behind a faint wisp of smoke.
Amidst the storm, Gaius' voice boomed, a desperate attempt to cut through the rising tide of panic. "Hold your ground! Don't charge! Let them come to us!" His words were lost in a fresh wave of screams as another earth-shattering war cry rang from the woods.
From the dense foliage on either side, figures emerged like phantoms. Xaltocan warriors it seems, their bodies painted in stripes of red and white, their heads with that ever so familiar feathers, thrusted their gleaming spears with a deadly hunger as they surged forward, a wave of savage fury crashing against our defensive line.
Pandemonium erupted. Absolute Pandemonium, the raw fear that had been simmering beneath the surface had boiled over. Some dropped their shields and fled, only to get struck by spears or arrows, their panicked cries adding to the growing chaos. Those who still remain, even by the skin of the teeth, slamming our shields and gladius into the attackers and thrusting our pilum javelins forward. The clash of steel on obsidian filled the air, a brutal symphony of war that drowned out the screams of the dying, Roman and Xaltoan alike.
Around me, the scene was a horrifying ballet of violence. A young recruit, barely out of his teens, crumpled to the ground, a feathered spear protruding from his chest like a grotesque flower. A Xaltocan warrior, his face locked in a murderous grin, locked blades with Titus, their weapons sparking with blinding flashes as they fought with desperate intensity. Gaius, his face a mask of fury unlike anything I'd ever seen, hacked his way through the onslaught, his polished armor gleaming like a beacon amidst the carnage.
Aulus' haunted eyes and the stories of fallen forts lingered in my mind, a constant reminder of the brutal reality of this new land. These people might be different, they might fight with forbidden magic and a ferocity we'd never witnessed before, but one thing was certain, they wouldn't crack the legionnaires. We wouldn't fall here, not today. 
The brutal clash of steel on obsidian stretched on for what felt like hours. Time warped and stretched, each clang of weapons and scream of the dying blurring into a single hurricane of sound. Sweat sting my eyes, my arms ached with the constant strain of holding my shield, blocking the relentless barrage of arrows and spear thrusts. The stench of blood and iron filled the air, an unrelenting smell that clung to my nostrils.
Around me, the scene was nothing but gruesome devastation. Bodies, both Roman and Xaltocan, littered the forest floor like discarded puppets. A legionnaire, a few paces away fought with the desperation of a cornered animal, faced a mask of fury as he parried a Xaltocan warrior's spear with his gladius, the metallic clangs echoing in the woods amidst the carnage.
Just beyond the chaos, the forest itself bore the scars of the battle. Trees were marked by glancing blows, their bark shredded and blackened. The once-lush undergrowth was trampled and bloodstained, a testament to the desperate struggle that had unfolded beneath the trees.
Then, just as abruptly as it began, the fighting stopped. The Xaltocan warriors, their initial fury seemingly dissolved, pulled back with surprising agility. Weary limbs then sagged, sweat-slick faces were lifted to the sunlight filtering through the leaves.
Gaius, his armor dented and bloodied, scanned the treeline, a wary glint in his eyes. A slow smile spread across his face, the grim tension momentarily forgotten. "Victory!" he roared, his voice hoarse but triumphant. "They're gone! Rome stands strong!"
A cheer erupted, a ragged, but heartfelt roar that echoed through the woods. The raw fear that had gripped the men moments ago seemed to dissipate, replaced by a surge of adrenaline and a newfound confidence. Even the veterans allowed themselves a moment of respite. We had held our ground, ambushed by these unholy peoples and repelled the onslaught. Perhaps, just perhaps, the road to glory was one step ahead.
The cheers slowly faded into a murmur of exhausted chatter. I took a moment to catch my breath, glancing around at my fellow soldiers. Some leaned on their shields, wiping sweat from their brows. Others tended to their wounds, faces etched with grim determination as we lifted the wounded against trees to rest.
Just as we were tending the wounded, a sudden, terrifying volley of arrows flew through the trees. I barely managed to raise my shield, blocking off some of the arrows, others though, weren't so lucky. The world exploded in chaos once more. A glint of obsidian flashed at the edge of my vision, followed by another, and another. A fresh torrent of spears rained down upon us, this time accompanied by the chilling war cries of unseen Xaltocan warriors erupting from the very depths of the forest. 
Gaius' triumphant expression evaporated, replaced by a grim realization. We had been too quick to celebrate. This cunning maneuver… The Xaltocan assault had been a farce, a calculated withdrawal designed to lure us into a false sense of security. The cheers and bravado moments ago were replaced by a frantic scramble for cover. "Form ranks!" Gaius bellowed, his voice laced with urgency. "Shields up! Prepare for another attack! But this time, we slowly retreat, remember, in formation!"
Panic pulsed through the clearing like a poisoned dart. We scrambled for cover, shields slamming together in a desperate attempt to ward off the onslaught. Arrows whizzed through the air, their obsidian tips glinting wickedly in the sunlight.
"If you can hear my voice, you'll be rear guard with me!"
Rear guard… In this tornado of flying death, a euphemism for a suicide mission. Yet, there was no room for protest. Gaius herded dozens towards the rear of the retreating line. 
The retreat itself was a desperate dance, a chaotic flow of bodies desperately seeking cover while still maintaining a semblance of formation. Every agonizing step back felt heavy, as if shackled to the earth. Each spear that thudded into the ground, each arrow that found its mark, chipped away at our shields and morale. Despite our somewhat hazy, although clear formation, the Xaltocans seemed to find the gaps, emerging from the woods only to disappear in the fray.
A young soldier, barely out of his teens, crumpled beside me, his eyes wide with a terror that mirrored my own. An arrow protruded from his throat, silencing the laughter that had only yesterday filled our shared cabin. Another man, a seasoned veteran with a salt-and-pepper beard that spoke of countless campaigns, fell a moment later, a spear protruding from his chest. His grip on his pilum slacked, the weapon clattering to the forest floor with a hollow thud.
Before I could blink, a rough hand suddenly clamped on my shoulder, pulling me back from the chaos. "Marcus! We need to go! Now! Seems like these Xaltocans started to hold their push!" It was Gaius, his face grim, his eyes filled with a desperate urgency.
half-carrying and half-dragging myself, I stumbled back towards the remaining survivors. Aulus quickly spotted me and wasted no time grabbing my arm, his grip surprisingly firm despite the tremor in his own hand, we stumbled back through the undergrowth, a chaotic throng of desperate men fleeing the relentless hail of arrows and spears.
Each agonizing step was an eternity. The jungle floor seemed to conspire against us, threatening to swallow us whole with every step. With every frantic glance back, the clearing grew smaller, the carnage receding into the distance. My breath came in ragged gasps as my lungs, starved for air, burns.
Suddenly, a searing pain erupted in my shoulder, a jolt that sent me sprawling onto the earth. A rouge arrow, its tip tipped with obsidian, protruded from my left shoulder. Aulus, ever vigilant, materialized beside me in a blur of motion, ripped the thing from my shoulder, he then shoved a bottle into my hand, urging me to drink deeply.
"Up, Marcus!" he roared, "We're not done yet!"
I scrambled to my feet. The world tilted and spun around me, but with Aulus' arm slung around my shoulder, we continued our retreat. The once relaxing sounds of the jungle now seemed alien, morphed by the fog of pain and grief clinging on to me.
The walk to the fort stretched into an eternity, bodies litter the forest floor left, right and center, tinting the dirt a dull red, Roman and Xaltocan alike, they all lay next to each other, slain in gruesome ways a direct hit from a catapult sounds more humane than all of this carnage.
Then and there, the true scale of this ambush, the true scale of this blunder, had made itself clear, dozens, if not hundreds had fallen for seemingly nothing. Taking a glance at Gaius, I saw a face vaguely mirroring my own, it hinted of disappointment rather than horror as Gaius, and the other higher-ups saw these fallen comrades through the eyes of documents, seeing them as numbers while I saw them as… well… human beings.
Nevertheless, time seemed to lose all meaning, measured only by the agonizing rhythm of steps. The lush green canopy of the jungle, once a source of curiosity, now mocked me with its disregard to the carnage.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the timber of the fort gate loomed ahead. With a final, herculean effort, I stumbled through the gate, collapsing against a heap of firewood nearby.
The fort, once a symbol of order and safety, now resembled a churning anthill. Wounded men limped towards the makeshift medical tent, their faces etched with pain and exhaustion. Others, their armor dented and chipped with shields on the brink of obliteration, shouted orders in a desperate attempt to restore some semblance of control. 
As the camp erupted in a firestorm of movement, Lucius approached me, shield lodged with an obsidian spear and face etched with exhaustion.
"Quite the decoration huh?" Lucius remarked, before tossing his shield and sat ontop of the heap right next to me.
"I got this thing lodged mid-battle, looks pretty so i'm keeping this, you?" he asked, "nothing much, brought back disappointment and resentment really" i answered in an exasperated tone.
"I'm sure you saw that too, a million fallen comrades just littering the floor" I continued, staring off into the distance. "Aulus is right, it's just a matter of time until this camp fall"

Chapter XV

A new day dawned, adding a new layer of time that clouds my memory of that day countless comrades departed from this realm, the rhythmic snores of Aulus, my watchtower companion, vibrated through the wooden floorboards, a surprisingly peaceful counterpoint to the symphony of nighttime jungle sounds and the spirits of our passed comrades. Leaning against the railing, I gazed out across the sprawling expanse of the camp. Sunlight painted the scene in an otherworldly glow, casting long shadows that danced across the newly erected walls. A far cry from the hastily thrown-together wooden fence that had served as our initial defense, the walls now stood tall and proud, a testament to the tireless labor of the men.
Gone were the days of nervous glances cast towards the treeline, the constant fear of surprise attacks. Here, within the confines of the camp walls, a sense of order had begun to take root. Smoke curled lazily from countless campfires scattered around the camp, promising a warm meal and respite from the ever-present humidity. Laughter and the rhythmic clang of hammer on metal drifted up from a makeshift workshop near the center and despite the determined hammering, it resembled more to a carpenter's workshop back home than the military engine churning out war machines I envisioned. Yet, it was a bustle of activity nonetheless, a heart pumping life into this exclave.
My gaze swept across the camp, taking in the signs of progress, the campfires, the sturdy gates, the rhythmic buzz of activity. A sense of pride then made itself known in my chest. We built, we conquered, we adapted. This jungle, no matter how hostile, would eventually bend to our will in a snap.
But as my gaze drifted towards the center of the camp, it snagged on a single object, a tall pole adorned with a bronze eagle, its wings outstretched in a defiant pose. Though, the defiant pose seemed a bit hollow next to its grim purpose. The eagle wasn't the only thing adorning the pole. Beneath it hung dozens of names, each one etched and carved deep into the wooden pole a sorrowing memorial to those who wouldn't see another sunrise. A stark reminder of the brutality that lurked just beyond the walls.
My gaze drifted back towards the forest, a dense and solid wall of green and brown that seemed to press on the edges of the camp. The recent ambush, a harrowing experience that had left countless comrades dead and wounded sparked a tornado within me, would this emerald prison claim more lives? How many more names would be added before this madness ends? Titus with his booming laugh and unwavering loyalty. Aulus, my snoring companion just a few feet away and Lucius with his witty jokes, his fate yet unwritten. Would their names join the countless others on that grim memorial? Or would they see tomorrow's dawn?
The weight of their unspoken worries, and my own, pressed down on me. Nature's beautiful symphony playing seemed to falter, replaced by silence. The melodic chirping of birdsong filling the air, nature, in all its beauty, thrived here, oblivious to the petty human conflict that unfolded within its hands.
With a conscious effort, I shook off the oppressive thoughts. There would be time for pondering the cost of war later. For now, I would focus on the simple act of breathing, the feel of the warm sunlight on my skin, the symphony of life playing out around me. Perhaps, in this alien beauty, I could find a sliver of solace, a temporary escape from the harsh realities that could and would descend at any moment.
But just as a sense of calm started to settle, a commotion erupted from the jungle path leading into the camp. A frantic band of scouts, faces contorted in raw panic, bursted into view. They tore through the camp at breakneck speed, their ragged breaths and pounding boots echoing off the newly built wooden walls.
Instinct took over. Adrenaline surged through me as my hand shot out, grabbing the lever that controlled the main gate. But before I could even consider throwing it open, the lead scout, a man with eyes wide with terror, didn't even think the gate's made out of wood. He raised one leg and kicked the gate with full force, slamming his foot into the heavy wood with the force of a battering ram, the impact reverberating through the watchtower and jolting Aulus awake with a startled yelp. "Gods above!" he roared, his earlier drowsiness forgotten. "What in Jupiter's name is happening?"
Ignoring Aulus's compains, I shoved the lever forward with all my might. The heavy gate groaned in protest as it swung open a fraction, just enough for the lead scout to tumble through in a heap. Behind him, the remaining scouts piled in after their leader, a human avalanche of fear and exhaustion. They stumbled through the opening, gasping for air, their desperate pleas and frantic warnings swallowed by the sudden cacophony.
But the moment the last scout was through, I slammed the lever shut again. The heavy gate groaned in protest as it slammed shut, the reinforced wood shuddering under the impact. The sound echoed through the camp and probably jumped the half-asleep Aulus for a second time, a jarring counterpoint to the symphony of nature that moments ago had filled the air.
Aulus scrambled to his feet, throwing a fresh torrent of very colorful words at my bloodline with no concern for the current mountain of slouched and curled scouts.
When the very friendly Aulus finally realized why I wasn't paying a single attention, he swiveled his head towards the approaching Gaius and the recovering scouts. his protest of an interrupted sleep faltered, giving way to a new batch of concern. 
"What is it? What did they see?" he rasped.
"I don't know," I admitted, my voice tight. The adrenaline that had surged through me moments ago had solidified into a knot of dread in my stomach. But the scouts' frantic scramble into the camp spoke volumes louder than the gates they had rammed into.
Aulus' question went unanswered for a moment, a pause filled only by the ragged gasps of the scouts regaining their breath. Then, Gaius pushed his way through the throng of soldiers gathering around the newcomers. His face, usually weathered and stoic, was etched with a deep furrow of worry. He knelt before the lead scout, whose eyes still reflected the terror of whatever they had encountered.
"Report," Gaius barked, his voice tight with urgency. The young scout, his chest heaving with exertion, took a shuddering breath. "Sir," he gasped, his voice hoarse. "We… We set-off at the crack of dawn, we received orders to spy on a Xaltocan village quite far upstream from the nearby river. But just beyond the walls of the village… there… there…" His voice trailed off, replaced by a strangled sob. Gaius placed a reassuring hand on the scout's shoulder, his own brow creased with concern. "I haven't… nevermind. There what??" he pressed gently.
The scout took another shaky breath, then blurted out, "An army. A Xaltocan army. Uncountable numbers of them. They… they were marching towards the fort." Each syllable a blow to our fragile sense of security. The color drained from Gaius' face, replaced by a grim determination. He knew, as I did in that very moment, that the fragile peace we had carved out in this alien jungle was about to be shattered.
A small circle of legionaries materialized around the panting scouts and Gaius. Curiosity etched on their faces, they strained to hear the rest of the report in a hushed tone.
Unlike the controlled rush of anticipation before a planned skirmish, this was raw panic, a frantic scramble for survival. Without a word, I bolted through the watchtower hatch and raced down the wooden steps, taking them two at a time. Aulus was surprisingly agile, hot on my heels as we both dashed towards the center field, anticipating new orders from Gaius.
We bursted just as the first legionaries, alerted by the commotion, flooded from their tents. Confusion and fear on their faces as everybody else converged on the center field where the scouts and Gaius were jogging to, their frantic words punctuated by gestures that spoke volumes of the terror they had witnessed.
My initial urge was to push through the throng of soldiers, to shove my way to Gaius and hear the details for myself. But a sense of morbid fascination held me back. I didn't need to hear any further report. The urgency in Gaius' broad shoulders, the way his jaw clenched with each whispered word from the scouts, told a story all its own. With a barked order, a legionnaire sprinted towards the central platform and blew a long, piercing blast on the assembly horn. The call sliced through the air, shattering the fragile peace that had held for a fleeting moment. Within seconds, soldiers from all corners of the camp poured out of their tents, faces etched with confusion and a dawning sense of dread.
As more legionaries materialized from the various corners of the camp, their initial confusion swiftly transformed into grim determination. Shields were snatched from makeshift racks, spears were hefted, and swords were drawn with great haste. The rhythmic clang of metal on metal filled the air, a grim counterpoint to the frantic shouts and muttered prayers.
As the seconds stretched into minutes, the camp buzzed before my very eyes. The bustling hub of activity, the image of a humble civilization that had revealed itself in mere moments ago, vanished. In its place stood an anthill of warriors, a stark contrast to the peaceful serenity that had reigned only a heartbeat ago.
By the time Gaius mounted a makeshift platform built from a pile of lumber, a sizable crowd had gathered, spilling over into the tents. The normally bustling camp was now a sea of anxious faces, a palpable tension hanging heavy in the humid air. Gaius wasted no time.
"Legionaries!" he boomed, his voice carrying across the clearing. "We have received disturbing news from our scouts. An incoming army, vast in number, approaches our position as we speak!"
Faces hardened, shields were grasped tighter, and swords were half-drawn from their scabbards. The once bustling camp, a testament to our progress, now resonated with a different kind of energy, a steely resolve, a mixture of fear and defiance.
"We are outnumbered," Gaius continued, his voice unwavering. "But we are Romans! We will not surrender this ground without a fight. However," he continued, his voice dropping to a more measured tone, "we must be strategic. A frontal assault against an unknown force would be obvious, but suicidal."
"so," he declared, his voice ringing with authority, "I propose a daring maneuver. We will send a force to sally forth, to meet the Xaltocan vanguard and assess the true size of their army. This force will consist of the eastern quarter of the camp. The remaining legionaries will stay behind and defend the fort. We will fight, but we will fight smart."
A gasp then rose, alongside murmurs of discontent from the crowd. These men, the memory and the scars of the recent ambush still fresh in both their minds and skin. The prospect of facing another fight, especially against overwhelming odds, filled them with a weary dread.
Gaius held up a hand, silencing the grumbling. "I understand your fatigue," he acknowledged, his voice low but firm. "We have fought hard to establish this foothold. But surrendering is not an option. We will fight!" he continued, a glint appearing in his eye, "However, we will not fight on their terms. We will fight on our own!"
A spark of curiosity then momentarily filled the legionaries' eyes. Gaius leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "I mentioned that the Xaltocans were vast in number, correct?" A chorus of grunts confirmed his words. "Then," he continued, his voice rising again, "let us use that very fact against them! We will lure out a portion of their army, a manageable vanguard. We will engage them in a hit-and-run skirmish, using the very tactics they struck us with, swift strikes and sudden retreats! By the time they had arrived, they will face a fort with overwhelming men"
"We may be far from our home," he boomed, his voice rough with years of battle cries, "but the spirit of our ancestors still burns bright! Our ingenuity has always been our weapon, just as much as our gladius" he paused, gasping another breath of air to fuel the crowd's raging inferno. "The scrolls of old spoke of Cannae, how Scipio turned Hannibal's own tactics against him, luring the Carthaginian army into a trap and shattering their seemingly invincible ranks!"
The mention of Cannae, a pivotal Roman victory against a vastly superior force, it resonated deeply with the legionaries. The mere mention of such a triumph, fueled by strategic brilliance rather than brute force, flickered a spark in all our eyes.
"Gaius speaks the truth!" a centurion interjected, his voice rising further. "Let us twist and bend the Xaltocans' own rules against them. We will bleed their army one skirmish at a time, just like the way a farmer harvests their field!"
A cheer rose from the legionaries echoing through the jungle canopy. The weariness that had clung to us moments ago was replaced by a newfound determination, Gaius, with a satisfied smile playing on his lips, raised a hand to silence the cheering.
"This is a dangerous mission," he cautioned, his voice stern. "It will require courage, discipline, and most importantly, trust. The success of this mission, and the whole army hinges on each of you playing your part!"
Another wave of murmurs slowly starts to infect the crowd, this time laced with a mix of apprehension and a grudging respect for Gaius' plan. He pointed a weathered finger towards the eastern section of the camp. "Those of you stationed in the eastern quarter, prepare yourselves! We ride out as soon as possible!"
A cheer then erupted from the designated soldiers. It was a nervous cheer, laced with the weight of the situation, but a cheer nonetheless. In that moment, under the threat of an overwhelming enemy, these men found a flicker of hope in the audacity of Gaius' plan. A sliver of hope that perhaps, just perhaps, they could survive the onslaught that loomed.

Chapter XVI

The announcement bounced off the jungle. A silence then gripped the camp, broken only by gasps from the scouts and the nervous shuffling of men. Gaius' call for the eastern quarter seemed to hang suspended in time, defying the frantic scrambling that had moments ago dominated the scene.
Then, it began. A single legionary, a man, stepped forward. A low murmur of approval infected the ranks, then another man, then another. One by one, more and more emerged, their stoic expressions masking a mix of fear and determination. Each step forward was a declaration, a testament to their unwavering loyalty to Rome and the gods.
The eastern quarter, where I stood with a pounding heart, became an island of stillness amidst the swirling chaos. We, the chosen few, remained rooted to the spot, a silent observer before the storm. The prospect of facing a vast Xaltocan army, of venturing into the heart of enemy territory, was terrifying. Yet, a sense of pride, a burning purpose, had made itself known.
Gaius then scanned the gathered volunteers. Approval glinted in his eyes as he met my gaze. He raised a hand, silencing the cheers that had erupted across the camp.
"Legionaries," he began, his voice ringing with a quiet authority, "you stand before me today not because you are the strongest, but because you are the bravest. You are the ones who have chosen to face the unknown, to stand as the shield against a tide of enemies. Remember, you fight not just for yourselves, but for every soul within these walls. You fight for the future of Rome in this alien land!"
His words resonated through me, striking a deep chord within my soul. Fear, for a fleeting moment, relinquished its grip. A sense of purpose, a willingness to sacrifice myself for the greater good, washed over me.
"We may not all return," Gaius continued, his voice low and solemn. "But those who fall will fall as heroes, their names forever etched in the runes of history!"
A heavy silence descended upon the camp. Men exchanged solemn glances, the faces of my comrades, each with a quiet resolve. These were the men I would stand beside, the men I would fight with, and if need be, the men I would die with.
This was it. This was our final stand. We were but a sliver of steel against an overwhelming tide, we would face the Xaltocans head-on. And if the gods willed it, I would die a soldier's death, my name echoing alongside the greats of Roman history.
Gaius, his gaze sweeping over the resolute faces of his volunteers, saw the barely contained fire in their eyes. He wasted no time.
“Legionaries!” he barked, his voice cutting through the stillness. “The horde may be vast, but we are Romans! We are the shield that defends civilization! We march this very instant!”
A roar then erupted from the eastern quarter, a fierce counterpoint to the anxious shouts rising from the rest of the camp. Gaius, with a curt nod, turned his attention to the logistical challenges at hand.
“Break ranks!” he commanded. “Reform into smaller groups of ten. Mobility will be key in this mission. We strike fast, we strike hard and we melt back into the jungle. Remember, we are not here for a glorious fight, but for a cunning one.”
The legionaries swiftly obeyed, regrouping into smaller units. As friends and veterans gravitated towards each other. My heart pounds a frantic rhythm against my ribs, scanning the crowd. Aulus is already beside me, yes, but two won't cut it.
Then, I saw him. Lucius, in his motley band of eight or so.
"Lucius," I greeted, clapping the man on the shoulder. “we'll be with you, right?”
Lucius' face broke into a grateful smile. “Aye,” he stammered, his voice barely a whisper. “Tag along”
With a nod, I turned to Aulus, who had lumbered over to join us. “Looks like we're a band of brothers this time around, eh Aulus?”
Aulus, however, didn't return the grin. He ran a hand through his thinning hair, a deep furrow etched in his brow. “I don't like this, Marcus,” he confessed, his voice low. “Not Lucius or our squad, but this thing. This feels… different. Like we're poking a hornet's nest with a rusty spoon.”
Understanding the source of Aulus' unease, squeezed his shoulder reassuringly. The normally nonchalant man had been a shadow of himself ever since I arrived a few weeks ago. But fear, I knew, was a luxury we couldn't afford.
“We'll be alright,” he said with forced confidence. “We've faced worse. Remember the time we…”
My words were cut short by Gaius' booming voice, calling the newly formed squads to order. With one last glance at the anxious Aulus, I straightened my back, a legionary once more. We were a motley crew, a seasoned veteran, a nervous rookie, and a man haunted by past battles. Yet, in that moment, we stood united, a band of brothers venturing into the unknown, a flicker of hope battling against the encroaching darkness. As the sun began rising from the horizon, we marched towards the dense jungle, a spearhead aimed at the heart of the Xaltocan army.
Gaius scanned the newly formed squads, a flicker of satisfaction crossing his features. "March on!" he barked, his voice echoing through the clearing. Our group, with myself, Aulus, and Lucius, fell into line as the second squad. We marched in a modified battle formation, the usual tight ranks loosened slightly to allow for quicker maneuvering with men within each squad moved side-by-side.
Aulus, ever the voice of worry, muttered beside me, “This whole thing feels… off, Marcus.”
I squeezed his shoulder reassuringly again, in a desperate bid to ease his unease. “Like I said, we've faced worse before, remember the barbarians in Gaul? We were outnumbered two to one, and we still emerged victorious.”
He snorted, a humorless sound. “Barbarians and Xaltocans are two completely different beasts entirely, plus you can't just steal the catapult's kill.”
“Perhaps,” I conceded, “but their tactics are well-known to us by now. Gaius' plan is brilliant. We use their own speed and hit-and-run strategy against them! We bleed their army one skirmish at a time.”
A flicker of hope ignited in Aulus' eyes. “You truly believe it will work?”
“We have to,” I declared, my voice firm with conviction. “There's no other option. This is our chance to turn the tide, Aulus. Today, we fight not for glory, but for survival. Today, we fight as Romans, and today, we will win.”
We marched in tense silence, the rhythmic crunch of boots on damp earth the only sound breaking the stillness. The dense jungle canopy swallowed the weak light of dawn, casting shadows that danced around us. Aulus' earlier anxieties clouded my own mind, a distraction poking at my head.
Then, abruptly, the world fell silent. The symphony of the jungle seemed to hold its breath. The sudden quiet was deafening, a stark contrast to the nervous energy that dominated moments before.
Titus, his brow furrowed in confusion, brought the march to a halt. He raised a hand, signaling for silence, straining to hear any sound that might pierce the unsettling stillness.
Then, a faint sound reaches our ears, the unmistakable thud of distant footsteps. But unlike the rhythmic pound of a marching legion, it was a chaotic, uneven rhythm, like the hurried approach of a panicked mob.
A glint of suspicion hardened Titus' gaze. This wasn't the confident stride of an invading army. This was something else entirely. He barked in a rapid order, his voice low and urgent. “Legionaries! Take cover! We ambush them, not the other way around!”
Our small band scrambled for the undergrowth. branches scratched at my steel chestplate as I pushed myself deeper into the dense foliage. Around me, the other legionaries followed suit, disappearing into the countless vegetation and bushes dotting the vast jungle.
Crouched low, adrenaline coursing through my veins, I peered through the tangled undergrowth as my heart pounded a frantic beat against my ribs, I waited, senses on high alert for any approaching army, Xaltocans or otherwise, to reveal themselves. This wasn't the way we planned it, but one thing was certain, a surprise awaited us in the heart of the jungle, and we, the waiting predators, were about to learn the nature of our unexpected prey.
Then, the sudden cry of a war-trumpet, distinctly Xaltocan, pierced the air. It was a sound I wouldn't soon forget, a barbaric challenge echoing through the ancient trees. Before the last note faded, a volley of arrows rained down from the jungle canopy. Most whistled harmlessly overhead, lost in the dense foliage, but a few found their mark. A few clangs erupting from our left flank, followed by absolute silence.
Panic started to bubble up inside me, I flattened myself deeper into the undergrowth, using my shield as meager cover. Around me, the jungle floor erupted as the other legionaries scrambled for better positions.
Then, as abruptly as the arrows had appeared, they stopped. Then, with a bloodcurdling war cry, a horde of Xaltocan warriors burst from the jungle. They emerged in a wave of green and obsidian black, their war paint a grotesque parody of camouflage. Adorned with feathers and bone ornaments, they were a terrifying spectacle, their eyes gleaming with a savage hunger.
Before we could react, another volley of spears arced through the air, their deadly points glinting in the weak sunlight that filtered through the canopy. One spear whizzed past my ear, the wind of its passage ruffling my hair. It was a near miss, but it served as a brutal reminder to swivel my head every second.
Titus' voice, a beacon of command amidst the chaos, boomed through the undergrowth. “Hold your ground! Fight with discipline! Don't take a step back!”
With a deep breath, I adjusted my grip on my gladius, by the gods' will, we would not go down without a fight.
We met the Xaltocan charge head-on, a steel avalanche against a green tide. Gladius met an obsidian blade, the clash of metal ringing through the air like a chaotic symphony. My body moved on without thought as I blocked blows and delivered swings in a chaotic flail of desperation.
But amidst the chaos, a sight caught my eye. Some of the Xaltocan warriors, the ones seemingly leading the charge, wore grotesque necklaces fashioned from small, polished skull-shaped stone. As they fought, they blew blasts on the piece, shrieking a high-pitched cry that pierced my very ears.
Were these things some form of barbaric war cry or something more sinister? Black magic perhaps? The thought sent a tremor of fear as I quickly tamped down. This wasn't the time for superstition.
Despite the unsettling whistles and the sheer number of the enemy, we held our ground. We fought with a desperate ferocity, driven by the knowledge that retreat meant certain death. Slowly, ever so slowly, we began to push the Xaltocan line back. Their initial fervor seemed to wane, replaced by a grudging respect for our unwavering stance.
But just as a sliver of hope starts to spark, a deafening roar erupted from deeper within the jungle. The ground trembled beneath our feet, and the Xaltocan warriors, with renewed fervor in their eyes, let out a collective war cry that shook the very leaves on the trees.
The Xaltocans, in one bold move, pressed their attack with renewed vigor. Our carefully laid plans lay in tatters from this sudden change of pace, this irrational charge, this foolish change, but a change nonetheless. 
“These Godless barbarians!” Titus spat, “Defensive squares! Fend off this foolish assault and show them a true civilized engagement!”
With one order, the men sprung into a 2-man thick defensive square-formations, shields locked and pilums facing outwards, watching as the hoard of Xaltocans rushed our positions from the foliage.
“After the first wave, attack on my words!” Titus barked, we stood there, waiting for the inevitable, the incoming volley of arrows, the incoming blizzard of spears, the incoming slam of a mace. I held my pilum steady, ready to thrust it at point-blank at these soulless beings that took the lives of so many.
“Here they come! Javelins, go!” Titus boomed, the sound of “incoming” and “javelin” switching a lever in our minds as the inner square launched their javelins to the Xaltocans foolish, or brave enough to go within distance. 
I peered through the wall of shields as Xaltocan warriors fell, one by one as the pilum does its work, unwavered by the death of their comrades, the rest of the warriors dashed towards us with complete disregard to their body.
Suddenly, a sudden and powerful force threw the legionnaire in front of me straight into my face with a force that could only be described as divine. Laying on my side, I watched as my comrades lunged towards a Xaltocan warrior on the floor, followed by them falling backwards.
“Dammit! Do they not believe in rational thinking!?” one soldier muttered, it was Lucius, on the ground, recovering from a fall.
“What… what happened?” I shouted, Lucius, the great friend that he is, grabbed me by my shoulders and lifted me up with a face of deep concern.
“Are you good!? One moment I saw a flying warrior and the next you were on the ground!” he blurted, “no time for jokes, the Xaltocans are retreating, brace yourselves for a final assault!”
I hastily grabbed my dented shield that looks like it would snap with a gust of wind, and ready up for a daring dash towards the retreating warriors. Instead of the relief that followed from a retreating enemy, we were filled with rage, how dare they confront us and retreat again? Same tactic huh? Not this time.
Just as the last warrior delivered a blow to a shield, Gaius let out a cry of assault and the whole dispatch, myself included, ignited in battle cries, charging towards the forest and into the retreating Xaltocans.
In the corner of my eye, I saw a fleeing warrior, the faceless being dashing through the woods in an attempt to flee the roman assault, dashing from tree to tree in an attempt to shake me off. What is he trying to do? Fool a toddler? I'll give you that classic gladius sandwich goddammit.
The warrior, clueless to who's chasing him, looked back, his gaze locking in with my own, though not for long as his gaze then locked into my gladius, flying to the man at an arm's length away, the look of pure terror in his eyes at the flying sword comes to a halt as the sword pierced the backside, plunging deeper into the back of the warrior as the man halted this wild goose chase and slumped to the forest floor.
Before I could recover, all around me, the sight of Roman and Xaltocan warriors locking blades filled my vision as one by one, bodies began to collapse to the forest floor, both Roman and Xaltocan alike.
The Xaltocans, scanning the scene, decided to flee, this time, the other direction, they dashed with exhaustion in their steps with each man bolting away, clearly exhausted and not in any shape for another battle.
“Rear guard! Rear guard! Grab any wounded and fall back, looks like they are in-it for a third assault!” Titus boomed, voice cutting the chaos of breaths and limping soldiers.
With one deep breath, I looked back at the fallen man, gladius still lodged, “that's what you get for messing with rome” I murmured, cursing the very dead warrior before yanking the gladius. With one breath, I bolted towards Gaius, to join my retreating comrades.
As I joined the limping men, a voice shouted at me from behind, it was Lucius, limping on one foot as he desperately tried to clung on a tree. 
“You fool! Help me! Don't just stare!” he blurted. “The hell happened?” I spat, lifting Lucius and dragging him along with the retreating soldiers.
“I was chasing an archer, he disappeared into the forest, might still lurk there” he mumbled, eying the trees as I dragged him along.
“By this point, the Xaltocans were probably gone to their homes, ease-out and take a deep breath, camp's just beyond the horizon, plus, we got a whole army on our tail!” I announced, slapping Lucius on the back in a jovial manner.
“I guess, alright, lift me up and let's spri—” his words were cut short, “talking about swallowing your tongue, right big man?” i playfully joked, instead of the usual retort Lucius would threw, it's just silence.
“Easy there, you big guy,” I retorted playfully. “focus on getting your strength back will ya?”
Silence. I expected a mumbled curse or a sarcastic quip in response, anything. But there was nothing. Just the ragged gasps of my own breath and countless others.
“Lucius?” I mumbled, my voice a concerned noise as I took a glance at Lucius, there he was, face staring into the ground, unchanging
“Come on, Lucius,” I muttered, forcing a lightness to my voice that I didn't feel. “Just a little further and we'll be…” My words trailed off as the suddenly heavy Lucius got heavier and heavier, with an irritated brow, I turned around to pick up Lucius once again, he wasn't heavier of course, I didn't know why I thought of that to begin with. He wasn't moving at all, turns out.
my grip tightening on Lucius' limp form. Slowly, I turned him to face me, my heart hammering a frantic tattoo against my ribs.
Lucius' face was slack, his eyes vacant, staring blankly into the foliage ahead. No sign of life. “...Lucius?” I called, nothing but the empty face greeting back.
Then, something caught my eye, there on his left shoulder, an arrow, tipped with a vile green head, protruded from his shoulder, the fletchings stained a sickly crimson.
“No,” I rasped, the word a desperate plea to the uncaring jungle. “No, Lucius. Don't you do this. Not now.”
“This isn't funny. You scared the living daylights out of me, come on, say something!”
Lucius remained silent, the weight in my arms was no longer the reassuring weight of a comrade, but the emptiness of a lifeless body. Lucius was gone. My friend, my comrade, struck down this unforgiving jungle. 
“Marcus! Move it!” a voice called, it was Titus, calling me to hurry up despite the gravity of the situation.
My body reacted before my mind could fully process the command. I lurched to my feet, the world tilting for a moment. With one last glance, my gaze then switched to the arrow protruding from Lucius' shoulder, “so long old friend, so long”
Without a word, I lumbered towards Titus. My legs felt detached, my movements mechanical, the jungle sounds, the murmurings, all seemed muted, muffled beneath a thick layer of reality, true reality. My mind was a blank canvas, the vibrant memories of Lucius, his booming laugh, his clumsy jokes, now its pure emptiness.
Reaching Titus, I reported, my voice flat and devoid of emotion. “Lucius is down. Arrow.” The words tasted like ash in my mouth.

Chapter XVII

The jungle finally relented, its grip loosening to reveal a sight that should have ignited a spark of joy within me. The familiar outline of our camp, a sturdy wooden palisade nestled amidst the trees, materialized through the haze of exhaustion. Smoke still curling from fires, painting the orange sky with hopeful tendrils. Yet, the image held no solace. It was a completely different realm to this reality.
Gaius threw his head back and unleashed a triumphant roar. “Look at that, men! Camp! Hurry! The main force could come at any moment!”
His words were nothing but a muffled distant echo. The rest of the force, peering over the walls, waved and shouted their praises. A torrent of celebration came our way as people looked at us as if we were some sort of hero.
But to my ears, it was nothing but muffled noise, the joyous shouts warped and distorted with each step towards the camp feeling like walking through mud, legs numb and unresponsive. The once-familiar path stretched on endlessly, a cruel joke to my already shattered mind and body. 
My vision tunneled, blurring at the edges, all I saw was a smudge across the faces of the soldiers infront, a sea of faces condensed into a single, uniform smude, the cheers now sounded like the distant roar of the ocean, a muffled roar from another world. Each celebratory yell felt like a fresh blow, a reminder of the countless lives extinguished, the laughter silenced. The shared jokes, the camaraderie, the brotherhood, it all seemed like a mirage shimmering just out of reach.
“C'mon men! Rush inside!” Gaius boomed, urging me and Aulus back before the main army hit.
With each labored step, the weight of Lucius pressed down on me with a crushing force. His lifeless face, forever frozen in that vacant stare, haunted my vision. The memory of his booming laugh, the weight of his arm across my shoulder in countless battles, flashed like a dying flower in a wasteland.
Finally, after an eternity measured in numb steps, the entrance to the shared tent loomed before me. Pushing through my exhaustion, I passed the buzzing field and onto the eastern quarter, where many exhausted men huddled in their tents. 
Pushing the rough canvas flap of my tent felt like an insurmountable task. Inside, the familiar cot and simple wooden chest mocked me with their unchanged state. 
Collapsing onto my sleeping bag, the rough texture offered no comfort. All that remained was a hollow shell of the man. The cheers from the camp, the cheers of victory echoed through the tents. This victory, bought at such a terrible price, felt like a bitter ash settling on my tongue.
Then, the flap creaked open, a sliver of unwelcome light piercing the suffocating darkness I'd retreated into. Aulus poked his head in.
“Marcus, Gaius had permitted some in this quarter to rest while the rest defended the incoming onslaught” he said, “just remember, when you hear the blast of a trumpet, man you post”
I managed a grunt, my voice thick with a fatigue that went beyond the physical. “Some of the guys in our contubernium had caught a boar, were roasting it tonight, want some?” Aulus continued, “if we survive the incoming Xaltocan wave that is, need anything? Bandages, water or something strong?”
The offer bounced off my ears, a stark reminder of the normalcy that seemed so far out of reach. I shook my head, the movement small and devoid of energy. “No, thank you,” I answered, “Just… need some rest.”
Aulus' brow creased in concern. “Well, alright then,” he said finally. “Remember, trumpet blare, man your post”
With a final, hesitant nod, the Aulus retreated, leaving me alone once more as I sat alone in the tent, the memory of Lucius's booming laugh echoes in my head, a cruel phantom haunting the silence. I used to joke with Lucius about the mess in the cabins, the overpriced goods in Rome and my ruthless slam of a door that one time, it all stood as a stark contrast to the suffocating emptiness he found inside now. Every joyous shout from the camp felt like a fresh wound, a reminder of the life extinguished, the laughter silenced forever.
But just as he left, i decided that i had enough of this pondering session, all i need was some fresh air, and just like that, i mustered what little energy i had and stood, leaving by helmet behind, i paced outside the tent, sun beaming head as i scanned the surrounding camp.
“Marcus! There you are, I thought you're getting some sleep?” a voice called, it was Aulus, calling for me from the center field. 
Aulus, ever the pragmatist, had spent more time stationed here, witnessing the brutal realities of war more often than the crew who had taken a vacation to Rome while him and what remained of the initial force tried to make it another day. But even for him, the ambush that claimed Lucius seemed to have cracked something fundamental.
Aulus approached, his brow creased with concern. “Marcus, where's Lucius? You always hang out with him every minute of the day, but where is he?”
The words caught in my throat. “Lucius…” I choked out, the familiar ache in my chest twisting tighter. “He... he joined our original contubernium's men. An arrow… everything just felt… wrong…” my voice trailed off, the horror of it flickering behind my very own eyes.
Aulus remained silent for a moment, then let out a ragged sigh. “Wrong? War is wrong, Marcus. All of it. But here, in this damned jungle, it feels particularly cruel.” He looked at me, his gaze heavy with a weariness in his eyes. “I've seen good men, our initial contubernium, wiped out before you came in. You learn to expect it, to bury the pain deep, but it never truly leaves you.”
This wasn't just generic advice. Aulus's words held the weight of something i can't really grasp, but it held of something akin to wisdom, a reminder that i'm not alone in this grief. But Aulus offered no empty platitudes. “Be prepared,” he said, his voice rough. “For anything. The gods will test us in ways we can't even imagine." He clapped me on the shoulder, a gesture more of shared burden than comfort. “But we face it together, that's all we can do.”
“Be prepared,” he said, his voice rough. “For anything. This campaign… it will test us in ways we can't even imagine.” He clapped me on the shoulder, a gesture more of shared burden than comfort. “But we face it together, we'll see the end of this campaign… together.”
“Anyways, Gaius sent a group of scouts to check for any incoming army, get ready for duty,” he remarked, before clapping my shoulder and leaving me with my own thoughts.
"Ways we can't imagine..." I murmured, staring at the dirt below. I clenched my fists, a flicker of defiance battling the despair. War now, thoughts later, I told myself, before marching towards a gate, mind still a battlefield.
Sitting down at a pile of logs, i couldn't help but ponder at the words, Aulus, the man i abandoned for the good part of a month, from a nonchalant friend i once knew, now transformed into the elder of stoicism, Aulus' words, not just with shared grief, but with a quiet strength that resonated deep within. Here was a man who, in just one month, had lost his entire contubernium, the very soldiers who'd become his family in this foreign land. Yet, he stood tall, his stoicism a testament to his inner fortitude.
It was a strange kind of inspiration, this glimpse into Aulus' soul. If he could weather such a devastating loss and emerge unbroken, emerge in one piece, emerge as one man, then perhaps, I would too. Lucius' absence would never be forgotten, but maybe it didn't have to consume me. I glanced towards the gate, the gateway to the coming battle, filling me with a new kind of courage. We would face it together, Aulus, we will.
Suddenly, the camp erupted in chaos as the gate suddenly swung open when A scouting party burst through the gates, bolting-off towards gaius , their panicked shouts a stark contrast to the quiet that descended ever since the eastern quarter came back. This sudden change in atmosphere didn't go unnoticed however, as soldiers scrambled for their positions, the familiar dread of an impending assault gripped everyone as we manned our posts, waiting for the blizzard of arrows, the wave of spears, anything, to pound our walls.
Reaching the watchtower, I sprinted up the rickety ladder, taking my post on the battlements. Below, the camp buzzed with frantic activity. Just as I raised my shield, preparing for the onslaught of a Xaltocan horde, a commotion caught my eye. The scouts were huddled around Gaius, their gestures punctuated by urgent whispers. Gaius' face, usually a mask of stoicism I almost envied, contorted in a rapid succession of emotions, disbelief, shock, then finally, a wave of relief so profound it almost seemed comical.
What in Jupiter's name could have caused such a shift? It doesn't matter, the scouts frantic demeanor tells a whole novel of an impending doom. Nevertheless, we manned our posts, sweat slicking palms and tightening the grip on our shields and pilums. Every rustle of leaves, every chirp of an unseen bird catches our eyes. We were coiled tight, waiting for the Xaltocan horde to unleash its fury afterall.
Just as I began scanning the wall of tree trunks, my focus sharpened to a laser point. I wasn't just looking anymore, I was scanning the landscape with my gaze, squeezing every detail out of the foliage, my eyes piercing the jungle and seeing through the trees themselves. My breaths became shallow pants, each one a silent plea for any sign of movement, any glint of sunlight on metal that might betray a Xaltocan approach.
Then, a booming voice cut through the air. It was Gaius, his voice uncharacteristically strained but laced with a strange urgency. “Legionaries! Assemble!”
Irritation flared in my chest. An assembly? Now? But the thought barely registered. My body, still locked in hyper-focus, protested the interruption. My vision blurred for a moment as I forced myself to rip my gaze from the tree trunks. Could this wait? Didn't they understand with full certainty that the Xaltocan could be upon us any second? Doesn't the heavy panting of the scouts tell something?
After my little pondering session, I wove my way through the throng of confused and frustrated soldiers. Duty calls after all, a collective disquiet that mirrored my own. What could possibly be so important that it demands an assembly during a potential attack?
“Legionaries!” he roared, his voice echoing across the now-quiet camp. “The scouts have returned with their report. They have scoured the land for any sign of the Xaltocan army, and…” He paused, letting the silence uselessly stretch for an agonizing eternity.“They have found… nothing.”
Nothing? Just that morning, Gaius himself had announced an approaching Xaltocan horde. We'd braced ourselves, steeled our nerves for the inevitable clash, and now… this?
“Hold on a minute,” a gruff voice boomed. It was Titus, once puffing his chest to impress Gaius, now opened-up in an act of resentment. “Gaius, are you saying there's no Xaltocan army coming? You said yourself this morning—”
“Titus, I understand your confusion,” he said, his voice strained. “The Xaltocan vanguard was indeed turned away” He hesitated, his gaze flickering towards the group of scouts huddled nervously near the front.
“The scouts had ventured and scanned the land for the main force, but there was nothing to be found” Gaius continued
A gasp then ripped the ranks, quickly morphing into cheers and shouts of disbelief. Had we, against all odds, actually achieved victory without a full-blown battle? The weight of my spear suddenly felt lighter in my hand. Perhaps, just perhaps, the gods were finally smiling upon us.
No Xaltocan army. We weren't facing a massacre. A sliver of Lucius' memory, the echo of his final laugh, flickered to life amidst the chaos of emotions.
But before the cheers could fully erupt, Gaius raised a hand for silence. “Legionaries,” he boomed, a hint of pride coloring his voice, “today, the eastern quarter,” he gestured towards my quarter, “managed to repel a significant Xaltocan vanguard. They suffered minimal casualties, thirty-four legionaries wounded, twenty-five fatalities.”
The numbers hung heavy in the air. Twenty-five. Twenty-five bodies broken, twenty-five lives shattered. Twenty-five friends, brothers and sons are gone forever. And yet, Gaius spoke with the same detached efficiency he might use to announce a week's worth of rations.
My blood ran cold. Twenty-five fatalities? Did he just say twenty-five? Lucius wasn't a number on a report, a statistic to be tossed around. He was a man I'd shared countless meals with, endured grueling marches alongside, a life cut tragically short defending this very camp. And many, just like Lucius, were tossed around as “fatalities” and nothing more?
Gaius continued, oblivious to the storm brewing within me. “This victory should serve as a testament to your courage and resilience. We will celebrate tonight, but remember, vigilance is key. The Xaltocan threat may have receded for now, but war is a fickle mistress. Dismissed!”
The crowd began to disperse, the cheers morphing into excited chatter. But I remained rooted to the spot, my fists clenched so tight my nails dug into my palms. Victory? Celebration? These words felt like a mockery in the face of Lucius. turning him, and many, many brave and selfless heroes into mere pawns on a battlefield, losses mere numbers on a scroll, no respect, no honor, twenty-five fatalities and that's all.
When will Gaius, the mountain of a man, the face of Rome itself, understand the true cost of this "minimal casualty" victory? But duty held me back. This wasn't the time, not in front of countless men. Taking a deep, shuddering breath, I forced my anger down, vowing to find a way, later, to make Gaius see the human cost behind the sterile report of "minimal casualties." For Lucius, and for all the others we'd lost, I would not let their sacrifice be reduced to a mere number.

Chapter XVIII

A sliver of dawn light, cold and unforgiving, speared through the gaps in the tent, painting the floor in patches of white in a sea of black. The usual morning symphony of the men, the rhythmic clang of sharpening blades, the curses of guys wrestling with stubborn fires and the murmur of weary soldiers did little to pierce the fog of despair clinging to me. It's been the better part of two days and I still haven't got used to Lucius' absence. Every so often, I would swing my head to where Lucius would be, only to be met by air and the reminder of that fateful day.
Then, a booming voice shattered the morning quiet. Titus, the sound scraping against the nerves, wouldn't waste a trumpet call on anything less than a major announcement. Right now, all I craved was a sliver of solitude, a moment to rest. But duty, that ever-present Roman specter, wouldn't allow it.
As I stepped out of my tent, I watched as legionnaires started to assemble in the central field, their faces a mixture of curiosity and half-asleep confusion. Titus stood on a makeshift platform, the same pile of logs Gaius had so optimistically declared a sally. 
The early morning light glinting off Titus's polished chestplate holding a gleaming trumpet in his hand, the instrument lowered but obviously not yet silenced.
Resentment bubbled within. Didn't they understand? Didn't they see the emptiness in our eyes? the hollowness where the spirit used to reside? Another mission briefing, another push into the unforgiving embrace of the jungle, was the last thing I craved.
Titus raised the trumpet again, but before he could unleash another ear-splitting blast, before lowering it to speak. “Stand down, men!” he boomed, his voice carrying authority even without the amplification of the instrument. The legionaries shuffled into a semblance of formation, their gazes flickering between Titus and a stoic me.
“Two days ago,” Titus began, his voice dropping to a more conversational tone, “men from the eastern quarter proved themselves worthy of the eagle standard. You all fought with the courage of lions, Rome will sing your praises.” I remained silent, a statue against the slowly rising tide of nervous coughs and muttered agreement around me.
“However,” Titus continued, his gaze locking with mine for a fleeting moment, “intelligence suggests the Xaltocan threat is scattered for now. While pursuing them north might seem the obvious course, I propose a different path.”
A flicker of surprise danced in our collective eyes. Missions, especially ones announced with such fanfare, were rare. morbid curiosity stirred within.
“We've encountered two distinct groups of natives thus far,” Titus explained. “The initial tribes, ferocious but disorganized, and the Xaltocans, more disciplined but demonstrably different. This begs the question – what lies to the south?”
He scanned the expectant faces before him. "Perhaps another tribe, untouched by Xaltocan taint. An expedition south could open a new treasure chest, secure potential allies and replenish our supplies. Fortune favors the bold afterall!"
The prospect of a new mission, a chance to break the monotony of the endless jungle seemed to spark a flicker of hope within the legionaries. I, however, remained a stoic island amidst the rising tide of excitement. I knew Titus wouldn't have dragged me out here for mere speculation. There was more to this, something that demanded my presence, my participation.
With a heavy sigh, I pushed the well of grief aside, a soldier resigned to his duty. I would hear Titus out, but defiance will continue to live on, maybe perhaps, just perhaps, this mission wouldn't be another relentless march into the heart of despair.
Titus mentioning a tribe south of the Xaltocans snagged my attention. Had I forgotten something from the frantic days since the attack? Titus' words, however, sparked a flicker of hope within. The initial tribes we'd encountered months ago, the ones who attacked the forts, spoke a harsh, guttural language. Entirely different from the more seemingly structured language used by the Xaltocans, and the initial tribe we'd encountered and traded with? They spoke of a completely different alien tongue. Could there truly be a diversity of natives here? untouched by the Xaltocan taint? The idea, the possibility of allies, was almost irresistible.
With the murmur of the legionnaires settling, Titus raised his voice, his gaze sweeping across the assembled faces. “This difference in language,” he declared, his voice ringing with conviction, “it speaks volumes, doesn't it? Perhaps the Xaltocans are not the only inhabitants of this land. Perhaps to the south lies another tribe, untouched by their influence. Imagine it, men and women, people who might welcome us, trade with us, even become allies in this fight for survival!”
A mixture of surprise and dawning hope then settled into our minds. The prospect of allies, a potential nudge against the seemingly unstoppable Xaltocan threat, was addictive. Even I, trapped in the thick swamp of grief, felt a sliver of that hope.
“This expedition south,” Titus continued, “could be the key to turning the tide. Imagine, a steady supply of provisions, steel and most importantly, allies who can fight alongside us. We wouldn't just be pushing back the Xaltocans, we could cripple them, drive them from these lands entirely!”
Legionnaires then erupted in a roar of cheers, a sound so grand, it held the weight of their hope and their yearning for something more than this endless struggle, was palpable. I watched them, a silent observer, a part of me yearning to join the chorus, the other part tethered to the raw ache of loss.
Titus raised a hand, silencing the cheers with a hint of a smile. "Hold your enthusiasm, men," he rumbled. "This mission will be for the most resourceful, the most adaptable among you. We need those who can think on their feet and bridge the gap between cultures." His gaze swept across the assembled legionnaires, a spark of something akin to desperate hope flickering in his eyes. This was everything for him, a last-ditch effort to turn the tide.
One by one, Titus began selecting his team. A mountain of a man, a stoic expression masking a lifetime of experience, received a curt nod. A young scout, known for his nimbleness and his way with languages, was met with a warm smile and a clap on the back. Each selection was a piece of the puzzle slotting into place.
With a final nod to his chosen men, Titus dismissed the assembly. The selected legionnaires then scrambled to gather supplies, rations, bedrolls, and a mountain of trinkets and metal shards that might lure trade with this supposed tribe.
I watched from the edge of the crowd as Titus and his team took their leave. Their forms, laden with packs and weapons, marched into the green jungle, swallowed by the dense foliage until only the distant echoes of their footsteps remained.
Watching them depart sparked a new emotion, unfelt before. The chosen legionnaires, laden with packs and weapons, marched with a forced, obvious mask of bravery, a stark contrast to the weary resignation they'd had just moments before. It mirrored the image of our own sally force a mere two days ago, when we too, had ventured out with hope burning in our hearts, only to return broken and depleted. Aulus wasn't the only one we'd lost, countless brothers, countless souls, had vanished from the living realm to join in his journey through hades' realm.
And the cheers that had erupted for our return didn't make a dent in anything, those hollow echoes seemed like a cruel mockery in the face of our losses, a blind eye turned to our losses.
Nobody had understood, and I wouldn't blame them. Blinded by bravado, many joined the cheers celebrating the victory. Now, watching this new group depart, a cold sensation settled in my gut. The south held the promise of hope, but also the promise of a terrible cost.
When they return, if they return, there would be no cheers from me. Instead, I would seek out the survivors, those who bore the invisible scars of loss. I would listen to their stories, offer solace where I could, ensure no one had to navigate the suffocating fog of grief alone. The fort may not be the battlefield I craved, but perhaps, within these moss-covered walls, I could find a different kind of purpose. A purpose rooted not in glory or conquest, but in the quiet strength of shared suffering and the fierce determination to protect the living from the relentless grip of death.
The midday sun hammered down, turning the dusty training field into a shimmering mirage. Sweat trickled down my temples, stinging my eyes as I watched from the shade of my tent. The rhythmic clang of weapons and barked commands from the field was the only background noise other than the thousands of conversations from the eastern quarter.
Gaius, ever practical, had granted the sallying force a reprieve from the afternoon drills. A luxury some might say. 
I pushed myself off my sleeping bag regardless. The sudden movement sending a jolt of pain shooting through my shoulder, a little souvenir from the last encounter. A minor annoyance compared to literally everything else. I shuffled over to a nearby sack. Inside, bundled tunics lay scattered inside alongside some personal things. I pulled out my half-empty bottle, the familiar weight felt grounding, a connection to a time before this whole fever dream that is right now.
Exhaustion got the better of me and after chugging some lukewarm water, I flopped onto my sleeping bag, the rough canvas felt like a battlefield compared to a proper mattress. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing myself to sleep. Maybe oblivion would bring solace, even if the dreams were likely to be haunted by the faces of fallen comrades.

Chapter XIX

I jolted awake, ripped from the fragile grip of sleep by a thunderstorm of noise. It wasn't just the usual murmur of the tent, or even neighboring tents, there was a greater edge to it, my tent, usually a haven of relative quiet, seemed to buzz with unseen energy.
Throwing off the thin blanket, I scrambled to my feet, the world momentarily tilting on its axis as the last remnants of sleep clinging onto me. Voices, loud and clear. Curiosity propelled me towards the tent flap, stumbling about on the way.
Yanking it open, I was met with a scene of controlled chaos. Legionnaires moved about and In the center of the throng stood Gaius, his hands resting on his hips, taking in the activity, but it was the sight next to him that truly stole my breath.
Titus. There, battered and bruised but undeniably alive, stood Titus. The man who had led the southern expeditionary force, stood defiant amidst the throng.
What had brought about this sudden shift in the atmosphere? What miracle had Titus brought back? Did mighty Jupiter descend from the sky himself? My gaze darted towards Titus, searching for any answers.
Before I could even form a question, Titus spun around, his gaze landing on me. A grin, wide and genuine, split his dirt-streaked face. “Marcus! You won't believe it!” he boomed, his voice hoarse but filled with excitement. “We found them! A whole tribe, deep in the jungle! They're not Xaltocan, that's for sure. Cautious as all hell at first, almost took an arrow to the knee – ” he chuckled, wincing slightly as the movement sent a tremor through his leg.
“But we managed to talk things down,” he continued, “Seems they've been having their own troubles with those damned Xaltocans too! We traded some stuff, a few old tools for some decent food, wouldn't believe the size of those jungle birds they hunt! They even offered to help us too!”
Titus' words hit me like a wave, washing away the exhaustion and replacing it with a surge of confusion. A potential ally, a beacon of hope in this cursed jungle? It seemed too good to be true, yet here was Titus, face crossed with excitement from his tale. 
“Whoa whoa whoa, slow down! One moment we were basically a bunch of pessimistic kids and now this 'savior' descended from the heavens!?” I interjected, offering to spark any semblance of critical thinking, or even basic thinking at best.
“If anything, trading old rusty tools for some food sounds like a disaster! At least we could use the rust to our advantage…” I resumed, Titus however, wouldn't budge, letting out a sigh that rivals even the gods.
“What do you think Marcus!? Of course our initial trade isn't a pile of gold for a heap of dirt!” Titus interrupted, now with an annoyed tone, on the brink of outright breaking point.
Titus' switch-up sure had jolted me awake way better than any icy water could, a good punch-to-the-gut reminding me of my position within the roman army, which is the absolute bottom of the barrel.
"Marcus, there's more," he continued, interrupting my moment. “This tribe... looks like they've been suffering under the Xaltocan yoke for a long time. Their chief,” Titus hesitated, searching for the right words, “well, let's just say he wasn't exactly shy about expressing his desire to see the Xaltocans gone.”
While the prospect of an alliance was undeniably promising, we knew next to nothing about these jungle dwellers, their customs, their allegiances or the depth of their hatred for the Xaltocans. 
“Look,” I interjected, a flicker of unease snaking through me. “Alliances are good and all but these are uncharted lands. We don't know anything about these people, their end-goals or their motives. Maybe we should tread carefully before-”
Titus cut me off with a sharp wave of his hand, his brow furrowed in what seemed like annoyance. “Carefully? Marcus, have you seen what those bastards have done to this place? Have you seen the fear in the eyes of the villagers we've managed to liberate? This tribe, they've seen the Xaltocans' cruelty first-hand. They're desperate, and their desperation has turned to a burning hatred. They want revenge, Marcus!”
He grabbed me by the neck and dragged me closer, vaguely gesturing towards the throng of legionnaires, and onto the distant forest. “Think about it. With their knowledge of the jungle and their burning desire to see the Xaltocan empire crumble, they could be a valuable asset in this fight. We can offer them civilization, steel and the chance to strike back at their oppressors. In return, they can provide us with guides, intelligence, and even more.”
The logic was undeniable. But a nagging unease persisted. There was just something about this alliance that even Titus barely understood that left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I opened my mouth to voice my concerns, to urge caution before we blindly embraced these jungle strangers but before I could get a single word out, Aulus materialized at Titus' side with urgency crossed on his face. “Titus,” he exclaimed, “General brutus requests your presence at the praetorium immediately. Urgent business.”
Titus' face hardened. He glanced back at me, a flicker of apology in his eyes. “Duty calls, my friend. We'll continue this discussion later.” Clapping me roughly on the shoulder, he spun on his heel and strode off after the messenger, leaving me standing alone amidst the throng.
Frustration bubbled up inside me. This was exactly the kind of decision-making that had landed us in this mess in the first place. Charge headfirst into battle without a plan, rely on brute force and blind courage, and proceed to hope for the best, a recipe for disaster. We needed a more nuanced approach, a strategy more complex than his brain. This tribe, with their unknown motives and more, is a valuable two-sided blade.
“What was that all about?” Aulus asked, “sounds like someone woke up late today” he continued.
With a sigh, I turned away from the crowd, my unvoiced counterpoint lingering in the air like a half-forgotten melody. The workshop, a familiar haven of clanging metal and the sawing of wood. Perhaps the rhythmic labor would quiet the disquiet churning in my gut. But even as I lost myself in the familiar work, the image of the Xaltocan heartland, and the unknown path that led to it, loomed large in my mind.
Strolling into the hut, I was met with a cacophony of sound, the usual sawing of wood, the dull thud of hammers and the heated shouts of engineers mid-argument. Glancing around, sweat-streaked men labored over timbers, their muscles straining with each measured stroke of the saw. Sparks flew as another engineer wrestled a glowing piece of metal from the forge, his face locked in concentration as he shaped it with each strike of a hammar.
In the center of the room, a debate raged, but unlike the usual, good-natured bickering of the engineers, this one was leagues wilder and more viscous. Two figures, their faces flushed with exertion and a fervor that bordered on fanaticism, argued over the finer points of a mounted crossbow design. One, a broad-shouldered man with a beard as thick as a boar's bristles, gestured wildly at the machines they were crafting, his voice hoarse from shouting. “Thicker arms, I tell you! These beasts we face are no ordinary prey. We need the strength to pierce their thick hides!” he bellowed, his voice echoing through the workshop like a war cry.
His opponent, a wiry man with a shock of white hair that seemed to stand the intensity of the bickering, countered with a torrent of technical jargon, his voice surprisingly firm despite his appearance. “Strength is but one aspect! A heavier arm means a slower reload time. We need these crossbows to be nimble, to unleash a hail of bolts before those scums could react!”
“Nimble or not,” the other man roared back, holding a thick metal rod like a club, “what good is a hail of bolts if they bounce off some armored monstrosity?”
The engineers bickered back-and-forth with no end in sight, throwing a hail of mathematics and logic before the other one did the same, with an even more intense furiosity.
Trying my best to shake the argument off my mind, I strode past the erupting engineers, passing-by rows and rows of mounted crossbows and catapults, but as I walked past one, two, five, ten, infinite, I slowed my pace, coming to a slow, grim realization. 
Titus' frantic excitement, the sheer amount of machines, Titus's sudden call to duty and urgency in his voice...it all clicked into place. Yes we got catapults and all, but again?
Disregarding my own thoughts, I threw my helmet on an empty workbench, immediately getting to work, getting lost in the process as anticipated.
By the time evening had settled over the camp, I sat hunched over a workbench, meticulously repairing my almost-repaired helmet, the rhythmic scrape of my sandpaper doing little to quell the disquiet churning in my gut.
Suddenly, the flap of the command tent swung open, and Gaius, the thousand star general as he is, strode to the center field. A knot of unease tightened in my stomach. This wasn't a good sign.
Abandoning my work, I rose and paced towards the field. Around me, the ongoing drilling ceased abruptly, replaced by murmurs of curiosity. Men started emerging from their tents, drawn by the unspoken tension in the air. Soon, a sizable crowd had gathered, their faces turned expectantly towards the pile of logs we unspokenly agreed as the stage.
Gaius, his slight frame surprisingly commanding under the gathering darkness, stepped onto the pile of logs. A hush fell over the camp as all eyes fixated on him. He raised a hand, silencing the last whispers. Then, with a single, deliberate motion, he raised a horn to his lips.
A piercing blast tore through the camp, echoing eerily through the jungle canopy. It was followed by another, and another, until the entire camp reverberated with the blaring of trumpets. This was no ordinary announcement. This was a call for something far more significant.
The murmurs rippled through the crowd once more, this time laced with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. Men straightened their shoulders, adjusted the straps of their packs and exchanged nervous glances. The routines of camp life had abruptly halted, replaced by the anticipation of something momentous.
With a deep breath, I pushed through the throng of soldiers, drawn towards the platform where Gaius stood, his face resolute in the dim sunlight.
“Legionnaires!” he suddenly boomed, his voice echoing through the hushed camp. “For too long, we have endured the Xaltocan tyranny! We have fought them off from these jungles, but for how long can we remain on the defensive?”
A low growl of agreement rumbled through the assembled legionnaires. I scanned their faces, a mix of grim determination and flickering excitement reflected in the setting sun's dim light.
Gaius continued, his voice rising in intensity. “The time has come to take the fight to them! With the aid and guidance of our newfound allies, we shall launch a full-scale invasion of the Xaltocan western plains!”
The crowd then erupted into a roar, a sound of men hungry for battle. This was not the cautious murmur I'd expected. This was the roar of a caged beast finally unleashed.
Gaius held up a hand, silencing the cheers. "We Romans have a history of defying the odds," he said, his voice tinged with pride. "Remember Alesia? Remember Cannae? Remember our recent sally? We faced overwhelming forces, and yet, through discipline, innovation and sheer willpower, we emerged victorious!"
A wave of agreement and understanding infected the crowd. The Roman victories of old were ingrained in our very being. Gaius was tapping into that deep well of martial pride ingeniously looking back.
“The Xaltocans rely on the dense jungles for their ambushes,” he continued, his voice taking on a more tactical tone. “The western plains, however, offer little cover. Our formations will be less susceptible to surprise attacks. Furthermore, with the recent success in defending this very camp, our engineers have had a chance to breathe. They stand ready to unleash a new wave of war machines upon the demons!”
He gestured towards a group of engineers standing proudly at the back of the platform, moments ago they were heatedly arguing and now they stand united. 
The sight of freshly minted siege weapons sent a jolt of awe through the men, myself included. Quickly morphing into a renewed roar of approval at the engineers.
“So tomorrow, each cohort would spread-out and plunder as many resources to prepare us for a long siege of a Xaltocan city northwest, if any cohort should stumble into this city first, ignite a bonfire to signal your location” Gaius roared for a final time, the crowd nodded with understanding as Gaius stepped down from the makeshift platform, silently dismissing the assembled crowd.
My own unease, however, remained. Yes, the sparse woods offered an advantage, but it also exposed us to the Xaltocan cavalry, a force they might be keen on wrecking havoc on us. And while the new war machines were impressive, would they be enough to overcome the sheer number of Xaltocan warriors we were likely to face? Gaius' speech had ignited a fire in the legionnaires, but it had done little to quell the doubts that swirled in my gut. This invasion, so different from the defensive skirmishes we'd been engaged in, felt fraught with danger. As the cheers of the legionnaires continued to echo through the night, I knew a long and bloody road lay ahead. The question was no longer 'would we emerge victorious?', but 'would we emerge in-tact?'.


Chapter XX

A sliver of dawn light peeked through the gaps in the tent, painting the sky with streaks of pink and orange. The air, still cool and crisp, rustled the tents where we lay.
Unlike most mornings, I didn't need the insistent pounding of the drum to wake me from sleep. The sheer weight of the coming campaign had kept me tossing and turning throughout the night, my mind a relentless battlefield of anxieties and strategies. After a groan, I threw back the blanket and rose from my sleeping bag.
Gaius, the peacock man who had addressed all of us the night before, had made it abundantly clear, today was the day. The day we marched out of this exclave of civilisation and into the heart of Xaltocan territory. The day we traded defensive maneuvers for a full-blown invasion.
As instructed, I had already packed my meager belongings the previous evening, a worn leather satchel containing a change of tunics, some writing tablets, and a well-thumbed copy of a couple pages from the iliad. My armor, painstakingly polished the night before, gleamed in the light. My pilum javelin, its tip honed to a deadly point, rested behind me. Every legionnaire, myself included, had been instructed to come prepared for a campaign, one that might stretch for days, even weeks.
Stepping out of my tent, I was greeted by soldiers milling about, checking their weapons, finalizing their packs and stuffing their breakfast. Smoke rose from cooking fires, the smell of roasting meat and charred bread filling the atmosphere. The rhythmic clanging of metal rang from the workshop, the engineers, no doubt, putting finishing touches on their newly created machines.
A familiar hand clapped me on the shoulder. I turned to see Titus, face with a seriousness I hadn't seen before. Gone was the usual granite slab of stoicism, replaced by a steely glint in his eyes.
“Ready, Marcus?” he asked, his voice low and intense. “As ready as I'll ever be,” I replied, forcing a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes.
Titus nodded curtly. “Good, center field as soon as you finish breakfast, you'll need a clear head and a steady hand today. The road ahead will be long and arduous, but I have faith in you, and in all of our brothers.”
With a final nod, Titus turned and strode away. His words, however, did little to dispel the disquiet churning in my gut. This invasion, unlike the skirmishes we'd faced before, felt different. It felt reckless, a gamble against an enemy we still didn't fully understand. But as I looked around at the resolute faces of my fellow legionnaires, I knew there was no turning back, but with these determined faces, maybe, just maybe, I was turning a bit too crazy.
I gnawed on a piece of hardtack, the stale bread barely registering on my tongue. My gaze darted nervously around the camp, unlike the usual bustle of camp life, this wasn't the morning of a patrol or a skirmish. Today, the very ground seemed to vibrate with the footsteps of a thousand soldiers.
My tent, pitched near the main gate, offered a clouded, yet somewhat clear view of the central field, bustling with an enormous crowd that stretched to the edges of my vision. I gazed at the churning crowd in the distance, occasionally interrupted by the crunch of stone-hard sandpaper that is hardtack, when In the distance, a block of men started to creep its way up the path and to the gate, the unmistakable sound of hundreds of sandals pounding the earth in unison slowly getting louder with every stomp, led by a centurion framed by a plumed helmet, they marched purposefully alongside each other on their way to meet death face-to-face. A surge of adrenaline coursed through me, it was finally happening.
With a final, half-chewed mouthful of hardtack abandoned in my hand, I sprinted towards the center field, around me, the camp was a whirlwind of activity. Legionnaires formed up into orderly ranks, their movements guided by the barked commands of their centurions. Standards bearing the SPQR symbol fluttered in the morning breeze above the heads of the blob of soldiers.
I glanced back towards my tent, located just a stone's throw from the main gate. Just as a newly assembled century marched, another one immediately began forming within the drop of a hat, their ranks already forming up just within the heart of the field. 
With a renewed sense of urgency, I rechecked my comrades, digging through the crowd of soldiers towards the center. I scanned the forming ranks for any sign of Titus. But amidst the sea of helmets and determined faces, my friend and centurion was nowhere to be seen. Shouldn't he be here? Marshaling troops and ensuring order? Just as worry began to take hold, a booming voice cut through the chaos.
“Marcus!”
I whipped my head around, searching for the source. There, in the front of the forming century, stood Titus. Face set with steely resolve. He gestured sharply with one hand. “Fall in, soldier! We haven't got all day!”
with a single roar from Titus, the entire century went off. One moment, the world was a cacophony of commands, the next, a hush fell over the ranks, broken only by the rhythmic thud of boots pounding the earth from a distance. It was like a switch had been thrown, a single command that thrusted the whole formation forwards. 
This was it, the beginning. Shields were adjusted, helmets tucked secure, javelins gripped with renewed purpose. The hypnotic rhythm of marching footsteps an undeniable current pulling us forward. A tide of disciplined power thundering out of the camp and into the depths of this alien landscape.
The rhythmic stomp of boots vibrated through the earth, giving it a hypnotic effect. My mind, overwhelmed by the steady beat, started to drift. It was like surrendering to a wave, letting the current carry me instead of fighting it. My steps fell into perfect sync with the rest of the century, a seamless part of a larger whole. How did this happen? A hundred individual minds and bodies managing to merge in this perfect rhythm, It was almost like magic.
Pushing those thoughts aside, I focused on the world around me. The jungle looming overhead. Sunlight, filtered through a dense canopy of leaves, cast a mosaic of light and shadow on the forest floor. The incessant buzz of insects, the occasional screech of a startled bird, the distant roars of a dutch dragon, it all merged into the background of our advance. 
Before the feeling could fully blossom, the hypnotic rhythm of the march reasserted itself, dragging me back into its steady current. Brain off, body on autopilot. That's how the world works for now. The anxieties, the questions, the doubts, they could wait. 
The rhythmic stomp of boots rang relentlessly for what felt like hours. Sweat trickled down my forehead, stinging my eyes, the weight of my pack seemed to grow with every step, the dense jungle canopy offering little help from the relentless sun. Just when my legs were about to collapse under the strain, a commotion erupted at the front of the column.
A plume of smoke rose lazily into the sky, a stark contrast against the infinite cyan. A Xaltocan village nestled amidst the trees…
Before the initial surprise could fully fade, Titus's voice boomed through the ranks, sharp and urgent. “Testudo! Form testudo!” Just like that, shields were raised and pilums stretched, creating a shell over our heads and bodies.
The world became muted for a moment, muffled shouts, clanging metals and a heavy thudding dominated the air. And then, it began. A rain of arrows, tipped with vicious obsidian descended upon us. The dull thud of projectiles striking shields ringing around me, a terrifying first-wave of war. I held my breath, feeling the collective tension thrumming through the formation.
But just as quickly as it started, the barrage ended. Peering cautiously through the gaps between the overlapping shields, I saw figures emerge from the village, Xaltocan warriors, bodies painted in that ever so cursed warpaint with their bows drawn tight, ready to unleash another volley, then, some of them surged forward, covered by the second volley of arrows.
Just as the second volley of arrows rained down on us, a thought made its way to my mind. This was a full-fledged village, teeming with warriors. Has this been a trap all along? A dummy village, a clever Xaltocan trap. Where were the civilians? The markets? The cattles? The unease that had simmered low for days roared into a full-blown inferno. Potentially outnumbered, outmaneuvered, and facing an enemy desperate enough to defend their homes to the death. This wasn't the glorious conquest Gaius had promised. This was a fight for survival. 
No time to think, we got a horde of warriors rushing our-way. After the second volley of arrows waned, the cohort, bowing down to a silent command began to form the usual battle line, countless centuries, including ours unfolded from our testudo formation and into a 2-man deep line that stretched on either side, i found myself at the back, of this formation, ready to throw my pilum javelin at any would-be warriors. 
“Prepare to throw!” Titus' voice, time itself seemed to slow down. Every muscle in my arm tensed as I raised the pilum, around me, I could hear the rasp of leather as a hundred legionnaires mirrored my movement.
Suddenly, Titus roared, “Throw!”
With a collective surge of adrenaline, we unleashed our javelins. A hundred deadly projectiles arced through the air, a shimmering wave of metal cutting through the dense foliage. It was a strangely beautiful sight, a synchronized ballet of death. But the beauty was fleeting. The air erupted with screams as some javelins found their mark. Bodies crumpled, but most missed their mark as expected, the Xaltocans pressed on and we were in for the fight.
But the respite was short-lived. Amidst the hail of javelins, a new threat emerged. A torrent of stones, propelled with incredible force, rained down on the Xaltocan ranks. I whipped my head around, momentarily distracted from the chaos in front. There, on the edge of the clearing, stood a catapult, its powerful frame still trembling with the recoil of its first shot. A cheer rose from the rear of our formation, a sound both exhilarating and unsettling. The engineers, those inventive devils, had finally unleashed their war machines.
The catapults, symbols of Roman ingenuity, we're here to tip the scales in our favor. With a newfound confidence, I raised my shield once more, ready to meet the inevitable Xaltocan club.
The warriors, their faces grim with a desperate resolve, surged forward regardless, but something was wrong. There were fewer of them than I had anticipated, a far cry from the overwhelming numbers we'd faced in previous skirmishes. Perhaps, I reasoned, the wide-open space of the clearing made them seem less numerous. Still, their complete disregard for death itself needs to be addressed fast, war now, philosophy later.
The clash of clubs against shields filled the air. My pilum, having done its job, now lay discarded on the forest floor. I drew my gladius, its short, sturdy blade perfect for the brutal close-quarter combat that was unfolding around me. Parrying a blow aimed at my head, I lunged forward, thrusting my blade into the chest of a Xaltocan warrior. He crumpled at my feet, a look of surprise etched on his face. But there was no time to dwell on the kill. Another warrior, his eyes blazing with fury, took his place, forcing me back into a dance of defense.
While the front lines were locked in a brutal struggle, a different battle raged on the flanks. Behind us, the catapult thundered with renewed life. Each launch sent a torrent of stones hurtling through the air, raining down on the thatched roofs of the village, suppressing any Xaltocan archers that dared to take a stroll outside. The once steady hail of arrows had dwindled to a trickle, replaced by the frantic shouts of warriors scrambling for cover. The engineers were proving their worth. Their deadly contraptions were doing its job, forcing the Xaltocans to fight on our terms, a brutal melee in the open, the way brave and civilized people were supposed to fight, not ambush and retreat like dogs.
Inch by bloody inch, the Roman line pushed forward. Our gladius lodged in the flesh and bones of the fearless, albeit foolish Xaltocan warriors. And the Xaltocans, though fewer, fought with the desperation of cornered animals. They lacked the discipline of the legion, their attacks a flurry of wild swings and desperate lunges. But their ferocity was undeniable, and each fallen Roman soldier left a gaping hole in our ranks, forcing us to shrink our lines.
As we drew closer to the village, the desperate scramble of the Xaltocans became more apparent. Archers, their quivers depleted, abandoned their bows and snatched up clubs or swords from their Xaltocan comrades or fallen Romans, transforming themselves into makeshift infantry. But their haste proved costly. The relentless hail of stones from the catapults continued, raining down on them as they sprinted across the clearing. Here and there, a warrior crumpled, struck down not by a Roman blade but by a lucky projectile, blessed by Mars himself.
Then, with a shriek that pierced the sounds of battle, a blast from a Xaltocan whistle cut through the air. The remaining warriors, their initial frenzy spent, hesitated and bolted-off. A collective gasp rose from the Roman ranks. Was this a trap? Were they regrouping for a final, desperate charge?
Titus, his voice hoarse but unwavering, erupted a command. “Shields up! Testudo!”
We scrambled to obey, forming the familiar interlocking carapace with our shields. The Xaltocans, their initial momentum broken, did not charge. Instead, with a series of yells and frustrated gestures, they turned and fled back into the dense jungle canopy on either side of the village.
A stunned silence descended us. Slowly, cautiously, we lowered our shields, peering out at the village. The initial elation of victory was quickly overshadowed by a sense of unease. The Xaltocan retreat, especially after their initial display of ferocity, felt...off.
“They'll be back,” Titus muttered, his voice grim. “The Xaltocans are known for their hit-and-run tactics. This is just the first wave.”
We scrambled to obey a second time, raising our shields one more time, holding our breaths for the incoming second-wave of arrows and warriors.
But there was one element conspicuously missing from the battle, the thunderous charge of hooves and the terrifying cries of Xaltocan cavalry. It made sense why we haven't encountered any horses in past engagements, the dense jungle terrain wouldn't allow for such a tactic. But here? It's almost begging for horses. I thought we were on the back-hand for not having our cavalry but… Xaltocans? Natives? Something might be astray. Perhaps, just perhaps, those 'Dutch dragons' Lucius spoke off all those months ago held a terrible truth.
The tense silence stretched on for what felt like an eternity. We stood frozen, shields raised, waiting for the inevitable second wave. But it never came. No thundering war cries, no volleys of arrows, nothing. Were they waiting for us to lower our guard before unleashing a final, desperate attack?
Slowly, hesitantly, a lone Centurion stepped forward. He cautiously lowered his shield, his gaze sweeping the deserted village. One by one, the rest of us followed suit, the weight of our shields suddenly herculean.
The village laid before us, thatched-roof huts clustered around a central plaza, with strange monuments on the far side. But the unsettling silence remained, broken only by the buzz of unseen insects.
As we slowly approached the low walls of the village, we braced ourselves for an attack that never came, with a shared glance, we creeped forward, boots crunching on the dusty ground as the village entrance revealed a scene ripped from a forgotten realm. Huts, clustered haphazardly, formed a maze of narrow pathways. Smoke, though long extinguished, still clung to the air, hinting at a recent life. A wooden statue of a strange beast stood guard in the central plaza while a massive monument lay tucked away on the far side of the plaza, a second, smaller one just to the left.
With a cautious hand, Titus pushed open the door of the nearest hut. The interior was bare, devoid of furniture or belongings. A single, overturned clay pot lay discarded on the dirt floor. We moved from hut to hut, each one reflecting the emptiness of the first. Empty rooms, what we thought as granaries stood bare, usually overflowing with expected grain or whatever these Xaltocans eat, the pens, where we would expect livestock, were empty.
“What in Jupiter's name happened? This village looks new, feels new, but it's abandoned somehow” Aulus commented, exiting out of the millionth hut we barged into.
Some soldiers theorized that this was an already abandoned village, a ghost town, slowly being reclaimed by the jungle. Others, like myself, clung to the belief that this was a dummy village, meticulously designed to lure us in for a brutal ambush. But the ambush never came.
This wasn't the glorious conquest we had been promised. There were no riches to plunder, no captives to take, no grand display of Roman might. Just a deserted village, a heads-up to the vast emptiness that might await us.
Titus, his face grim, finally spoke after the tenth hut we sweeped. “Search the perimeter,” he ordered. “Leave no stone unturned. We need to be certain this place is truly deserted before we move on.”
Legionnaires fanned out, their movements a disturbance to the eerily silent village. 
“Take a short rest, we'll join-up with another cohort soon” a man boomed, voice laden with an authority that's far too great for titus, yet gaius was leagues away from our cohort 
“General brutus!” Titus roared, his back straightened and face sterned, Titus certainly grabbed the man's attention before pacing up to him and igniting a firestorm of complicated words, might as well be a philosophy lecture.
Left alone to my own will, I crouched against a mud wall, staring into the sky as the past few engagements had been far from glorious. We'd stumbled into the first ambush, barely escaping with our lives. The second had been a brutal brawl, saved only by Roman adaptability. Yet, here we stood, having seemingly conquered a village without a fight. 
Had Mars finally noticed the uncivilized peoples he rooted for? Perhaps Mars, in his infinite wisdom, had begun to favor the more civilized approach, a swift victory with minimal bloodshed. Maybe, just maybe, this campaign wouldn't be the meat grinder everyone had feared. Maybe, just maybe, we would emerge victorious, not just as conquerors, but as liberators, bringing the light of Roman civilization to these savage lands. 

Chapter XXI

Curled against the mud wall of a deserted hut, I fought against a foe i was keenly familiar on, not the obsidian clubs and arrows of Xaltocan warriors, not even the claws of horrifying beings the legionnaires had whispered about at camp, but the encroaching embrace of sleep. 
My eyelids fluttered, threatening to surrender to sleep, when a flicker of movement in the distance caught my eye. Squinting through the fading light, I saw a single, solitary figure standing atop a raised platform at the far end of the village.
Curiosity, a welcome distraction from fatigue, pricked me awake. Pushing myself to my feet, I strode closer, careful not to trip in the wildly uneven path as I drew closer, the figure resolved itself into a fellow comrade, standing motionless, his gaze fixed on a towering structure that dominated the monument.
The monument itself was unlike anything I had ever seen. Carved from seemingly a single block of pale stone, strange symbols, swirling and intricate, adorned its surface, an alien language defying comprehension. Above the symbols, carved in bas-relief, were the figures of beings unlike any human. Tall and slender, with elongated heads and feathered limbs, they held what appeared to be staffs adorned with even more strange symbols.
Despite the fierce rivalry between us, a sense of awe then filled me. These Xaltocans, these uncivilized barbarians as we Romans deemed them, had clearly possessed a level of artistry and skill far beyond what any scouting report had mentioned. And these figures on the monument… were they deities? The Romans readily acknowledged the existence of foreign gods, beings worshiped by other cultures. 
The sheer scale and dedication poured into this monument spoke volumes about the Xaltocans' devotion to their gods. Back in Rome, our temples were grand affairs, testaments to the power and majesty of our own pantheon. But this Xaltocan monument, though different in its own ways, held a similar weight. Here, in the heart of this barbaric jungle, they had crafted a structure that rivaled anything the Germanic tribes could muster.
Respect for these unknown deities, a healthy dose of Roman pragmatism that whispering of potential curses and a burning curiosity stirred within me. I circled the monument, tracing the intricate symbols with my fingertips. An urge to understand the stories etched in stone, to decipher the secrets held within these alien figures, but with a final, begrudging glance at the monument, a silent apology forming on my lips for any potential disrespect, I turned and rejoined my comrades as some had begun moving.
The mystery of the Xaltocan monument still clung to me despite the incoming bloodshed I just knew was coming. The war may have taken a turn, but one thing remained certain: the heart of the Xaltocan jungle held more than just danger. It held a world waiting to be discovered.
Regardless, the sudden movement within the village signed for my attention. I pushed to rejoin the throng of legionnaires. Orders were orders, and soon we were falling into formation, the rhythmic thud of boots echoing once more.
As we marched through and out of the village, a disquieting thought wormed its way into my mind. Our packs, usually laden with enough provisions to last for days, felt light. Yes, I know for full certainty that we are leagues, if not worlds, away from Rome, let alone the breadbasket of Anatolia, but we had entered the village expecting to plunder sacks and sacks from its granaries, only to find them bare.
Would we really face the same situation months ago? Would we resort to 'unconventional means' to keep our bellies from rumblings? What about Titus's hoopla about 'new allies'? 
Reaching the edge of the formation, I found myself next to Titus. Hesitantly, I cleared my throat. “Titus,” I began, “with the… unforeseen lack of supplies here, how do we plan to—”
Titus cut me off mid-sentence with both his voice and face mirroring the fantasy I braced for. “Our allies, they will stand alongside in this crusade. He who suffers before necessary suffers more than necessary, you will be fed alright? Just march along.”
His answer, vague and unsettling, did little to quell my anxieties. Pressing on with empty bellies into the unknown heart of the Xaltocan jungle felt like marching straight into a trap. But questioning orders, especially in front of the entire century wasn't an option. With a resigned sigh, I readjusted my pack and fell into step with my comrades. 
The relentless march stretched into what felt like an eternity, though, at this point i, along countless others had gotten used to marching in the humid air of this new realm. Sweat trickled down my back, soaking my tunic and my stomach growled in protest. Just when my legs began to buckle and my mouth about to word a complaint, we emerged from the dense jungle into a clearing. There, to my utter surprise, stood another cohort, their insignia proudly flailed around in the wind. This was entirely unexpected to me, a quick glance at Titus reveals more or less of the same shock.
“Looks like we got new friends to bring along” Aulus scoffed, his attempt at breaking the atmosphere faltering quickly as I thought he'd take Lucius's signature role, only to find out Lucius probably got a degree from comedy school for all those memories.
Regardless, we decided to approach the cohort, seeking an answer for this sudden encounter.
Then, a figure, General Brutus detached himself from our ranks and strode purposefully towards their General. The two officers met at the foot of a hill in the clearing, their exchange a stark contrast to the tense silence gripping both forces. They spoke in calm, measured tones, punctuated by curt nods and gestures. Both men listened intently as brows furrowed in concentration. After what felt like no time, both officers strode back to their respective men, announcing their plans.
"Legionnaires! By request of tribuni angusticlavii Gaius Decimus, we form a vexillation and join forces with our brothers of the fourth Cohort! Together, we shall establish a camp atop that hill!"
He gestured towards a rise. Unlike the tiny hills we had encountered thus far, this one was a behemoth, a broad, sparsely forested hilltop that could easily accommodate eight hundred men, perhaps even more. 
With renewed purpose, we surged forward. The hill, though imposing, offered a clear advantage from its peak; we could survey our surroundings while concealing our true numbers behind the sparse trees. Work began as soon as we dropped our packs. Shovels scraped at the earth while pickaxes chipped away at rocks. despite our battle-fatigue, moved with efficiency. Soon, a trench began to take shape, a defensive ring encircling the summit of the hill while catapults and all sorts of fun war machines were hoisted and mounted along points in our defensive.
As the sun began to sink towards the horizon, a movement at the edge of the clearing caught my eye. A group of figures emerged from the dense foliage. Their attire, adorned with vibrant feathers and intricate patterns, marked them as Xaltocans. But unlike the warriors, these figures carried no weapons, only large baskets.
Were they here to attack? Swords clenched and shields were raised. Just as I tensed, ready for a new clash, a shout rang out. It was Titus, his voice laced with a mixture of surprise and relief. “Hold! Lower your shields!”
Titus and Gaius strode towards the approaching figures with seemingly no regard for their body whatsoever. 
“What is he doing!? Is he crazy!?” a soldier spat, “If one thing's for sure, I'd turn around if those fools get struck…” he continued, voice still laced with disbelief and what seemed to be disappointment.
Words were exchanged between the two centurions and the natives, their voices too low for me to make out. Finally, Titus turned back and beckoned us forward.
"These are not our enemies," he announced, his voice carrying authority. "They are representatives of a tribe allied with the empire. They bring us food and supplies!"
A pair of soldiers hurried towards Titus and the other centurion, stopping by before getting their hands stacked with dozens of woven baskets containing something heavy, the faces of the soldiers telling everything about it, a couple natives decided to help out and climbed their way with the baskets, making the job look easy. But what truly caught my eye was the rolled-up parchment clutched in one soldier's hand. Titus snatched it with a furrowed brow, even from a distance, I could sense the urgency radiating from the document and Titus' protective attitude towards a piece of paper.
The men along with the natives strolled their way to the center of the hill, hands brimming with baskets, dropping all of it unceremoniously to the ground before prying it open to reveal a sight of a truly perplexing scene.
Baskets packed with fruits made a mountain of a pile, but unlike the apple or apricots, these baskets hold fruits even stranger than any I'd encountered months ago during our first visit.
Titus and the other centurion oversaw the distribution of these strange fruits and vegetables. The unfamiliar bounty was unlike anything I had ever seen before. There were plump, red spheres that held an unexpected sweetness and long, green pods that were covered in a layer of tangled green I presumed to be its leaves of some sort.
One such pod landed in my hand, a handful in fact, literally a handful as my hands are full with these pods, its golden husk feeling smooth and cool. As I stuffed most of these into my sack, I turned one over, only to be bewildered. There was no way to open it. No stem, no soft spot, just green. Looking around, I saw Aulus wrestling with the same dilemma. Some attempted to pry the pods open with their daggers, only to meet with frustration. Others, including Aulus gnawed at the ends, their faces contorting in disgust in the process.
A guttural sound rumbled from a native, a gesture perhaps, followed by a patient point towards his own mouth. He then reached into a woven pouch at his hip and withdrew a small, sharp implement fashioned from what looked like a blackened bone. With ease, he scraped away a section of the pod's husk, revealing a row of golden kernels. He popped a few into his mouth and enjoyed the snack before chowing down at the golden fruit.
The demonstration sparked a wave of curiosity among the legionnaires. Tentatively, I mimicked his actions, the bone tool surprisingly effective at removing the husk. Gingerly, I brought a single kernel to my lips. The texture was unlike anything I'd ever experienced, neither the dryness of a nut nor the yielding flesh of a fruit. With a hesitant bite, a burst of starchy and liquid taste overwhelmed my mouth. Though unfamiliar, it wasn't unpleasant.
Around me, similar scenes unfolded. Soldiers, initially hesitant, tried the strange kernels, their expressions morphing from confusion to acceptance. The initial disappointment at the lack of familiar grains was slowly giving way to a cautious exploration of these alien edibles. 
A chuckle escaped my lips. Here we were, Roman soldiers, brought to our knees by a fruit. 
As the men chowed-down at their newfound fruit-like things, a shout to an assembly called, demanding all our presence immediately from deep within. The sound of the sudden call, let alone the words had made the legionnaires moving and within the drop of a hat, everybody began moving, and soon, a crowd had formed around Gaius, standing on top a pile of rocks that served at the makeshift stage.
“Men! Our allies, the same one that had brought to you food and supplies had scouted our surroundings and had come to deliver a very crucial note!” Gaius paused, for air and to glance if we listened tentatively before continuing with his command.
“Our allies had clarified our thoughts on a city northwest to not only be a major city, but the Xaltocans' capital they called 'Yolotli', so, tomorrow, we march northwest to continue our journey ” he continued, 
“But, before we continue with our day, make-due with what you got, sleep on your shields if you have to, it won't be comfortable, but it's something” he announced, before stepping-down and pacing away to gods knows where.
“Well, it's getting late, I'll see you later alright Marcus” Aulus paused, taking his time to stretch and crack his back, “Aren't you gonna find a sleeping spot?” he remarked before walking away.
Catching up to Aulus, we both scanned the forest for a decent spot to sleep, the sun's coming down and if we don't find a spot, we might have to sleep in the trees… at least that's what Aulus told me.
Ever the meticulous ones, we started our search for a decent sleeping spot. The forest floor resembled a yard sale gone wrong, water skins, sacks, bags and the occasional stray sandal littered the ground.
“Looks like someone already staked their claim to comfort,” Aulus grumbled, pointing to a particularly inviting patch of shade already occupied by a snoring legionnaire.
We pushed deeper into the undergrowth, dodging low-hanging vines and swatting away particularly enthusiastic mosquitos. Just as despair began to set in, we stumbled upon a patch of relatively clear ground beneath a tree. 
“There it is,” Aulus exclaimed, a triumphant glint in his eye. He tossed his shield down with the flourish of a gladiator claiming victory. “Prime real estate, my friend!”
I eyed the spot with a close eye. It wasn't exactly a five-star resort, but it did offer a less-than-ideal comfort compared to the surrounding chaos. The only drawback? My snoring companion.
Lucius tossed his shield and bag at the root of the tree with the instinct of a god, beating me to the race to see who can claim the decent spot.
“Lovely,” I panned, “just what I need, a front-row seat to your nightly opera.”. Settling in for a spot next to Lucius, the ground was a tad bit soaked, a nearby shrub grew on the foot of the tree, adding more suffering and despair onto my slightly inconvenient sleeping spot, poking at my face and neck everytime i try laying down on my back, forcing me to sleep with my foot against the tree while Aulus, bless his mansion, gets to lay down on a nice big root, staring down at my suffering.
“Look who's getting a good night's rest tonight?” Aulus commented, staring, no, blaring down from his high throne, down to my contorted body.
“Seems like this patch of earth is specifically designed to poke every pressure point in my body” i commented, twisting and bending my body in an attempt to find a decent position to sleep in, dodging the branches of the shrub, yes, it was that big.
Aulus snorted. “Just think of it as a pre-battle massage, courtesy of Mother Nature. Builds character, you know.”
As the sun completely vanished over the horizon and the moon rose from its place, Aulus' torrent of complaints about the symphony of snores and the weather seemed to be never-ending, a new endless blizzard of not snow like in France, but of pure complaints. Despite this, a strange peace settled over me as I stared up at the constellations. The dense canopy of the jungle blocked out most of the moon's light, but the countless stars twinkled like a million scattered diamonds. 
The symphony of the jungle did little to help me sleep, but it wasn't the cacophony I initially thought. The chirps and croaks, the buzzing of insects, and the occasional howl all blended together into one sound, the sound of a living, breathing world, a world untouched by the chaos of war that had become our reality.
As I drifted off to sleep, a strange sense of awe filled me. Here, in the heart of this alien wilderness, under the watchful gaze of a million stars, the battles and the burdens of the Roman Empire seemed to shrink into insignificance. Perhaps, for a stolen moment, I could simply exist in this wild, untamed place.



Chapter XXII

A cacophony of clanging metal ripped through the fragile peace of the early dawn, shattering the dreams I clung to precariously. Pots and pans, used enthusiastically bordering on sadistically, clattered around the camp, effectively rousing even the deepest sleepers. I groaned and muttered incoherently as I swatted blindly at the ever-present mosquito buzzing in my ear.
I glanced towards Aulus. There he lay, sprawled on a massive root of a tree, completely oblivious to the symphony of sounds unfolding right beside his eardrums. The man could sleep through a barbarian horde, a talent I desperately wished I could have for a long time.
Resigned, I pushed myself upright, The pre-dawn air damp chill of the jungle sending a shiver down my spine despite the meager warmth of my cloak.
Around me, the men stirred into a semblance of life. Curses and muttered complaints mingled with the metallic clang, a chorus of weary men facing another uncertain day. I shuffled towards my bag, pulling out another one of those pods our allies gave out yesterday, still struggling to peel open the tangled knot of leaves despite a front-row audition to a native opening it with ease.
Without much of a grumbling protest, I accepted my situation, gnawing on the pod, chewing off whole chunks of the thing to slowly reveal the golden kernels underneath their troublesome layer of leaf, my side of coarse bread doing little to appease my rumbling stomach. 
Aulus, finally roused by the commotion and lumbered towards me, his hair a mess and his eyes bleary. He took his rations with a grunt, his usual morning cheer noticeably absent.
“Lovely wake-up call,” he muttered, taking a tentative bite of the strange fruit. To my surprise, a flicker of something akin to enjoyment crossed his face. “Actually, not bad. A bit bland, but fills the gap.”
Sure, this… thing wasn't unpleasant, perhaps, with a little imagination, it could even be considered… nourishing.
“Ready for another glorious day of walking, Marcus?” he asked, a sarcastic edge lined his voice as he broke the early morning silence.
I forced a smile. “As ready as anyone can be, I suppose.”. As legionnaires shouldered their packs and hoisted their shields, we followed suit, not wanting to be left in the dust by our very own comrades.
We shouldered our packs while we popped a couple of the strange, golden kernels into our mouths, chewing along the way towards Titus. Aulus was already halfway through his pod somehow, washing it down with his bottle within the drop of a hat.
We scanned the camp for Titus amidst the sea of faces and glinting armor, Titus seemed to have a habit of blending-in seamlessly despite his build, a massive feat of achievement some might say, classic standardized roman army at its peak, obviously not for efficient logistics, but to confuse soldiers to tap shoulders in an attempt to find a specific person.
After a great deal of… well… tapping shoulders in an attempt to find a specific person, we found Titus, third row, right column, a very obvious, yet seemingly random spot for our century to be in, regardless of spots, we slipped-in the quickly forming ranks. Observing other lost souls traversing through the sisyphus-like task of tapping shoulders in their bid to find their place.
Though I wouldn't blame them, today's formation differed from the usual line. We formed-up in two parallel columns of centuries in square formations. One line per cohort ever since our merging yesterday.
"New tactic, perhaps?" Aulus muttered beside me, his brow furrowed in thought. "Maybe Gaius is trying to create more… fluid formations, something easier to maneuver in this jungle."
I nodded, intrigued by the possibility. The dense foliage of the jungle made the usual close-quartered formations tough. Perhaps this spread-out approach offered a tactical advantage.
With a deep breath, I adjusted my grip on my pilum, the familiar weight a source of comfort in this unsettling situation. The rhythmic thud of boots on damp earth rose as the men began to move, a collective heartbeat echoing through the silent forest as we marched northwest, following the direction Giaus gave us during the march, the two-line formation slicing through the dense undergrowth like a steel blade. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig, a potential heads-up to an enemy that could be lurking anywhere in this verdant labyrinth, the unfamiliar formation, while intriguing, did little to quell my unease.
The oppressive jungle canopy swallowed the sunlight, casting a twilight-like glow over the dirt while the rhythmic crunch of boots on damp earth provided the soundtrack to our unease. We marched deeper into the emerald labyrinth, the two-line formation an unsettling innovation. Gaius, flanked by his ever-present Optios position themselves strategically in the center of the column. Their proximity offered a sliver of dubious comfort, if there was an ambush, they wouldn't be the first to fall.
As we marched, I couldn't help but overhear snippets of conversation between Gaius and the Optios. Their voices, usually booming with orders, were now lowered to hushed tones, laced with a thread of worry.
“This seems awfully convenient,” grumbled Gaius, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. “Our ally has never exactly been fond of the Xaltocans, but leading us straight to their doorstep feels… suspicious.”
A ripple of palpable, silent agreement rose from the ranks. The aid given to us barely made a dent in our rations it seems, was this a genuine attempt to aid us, or a cunning ploy to lure us into a trap?
“These damned directions” Gaius muttered, frustration evident in his voice. “ How can we be sure our 'ally' is leading us in the right direction?”
“We have little choice sir. Without it, we're wandering blind in this jungle.” a General answered, voice low and steady.
“Aye,” another chimed in voice a touch higher than the average male, “but the timing of their arrival… a scouting party just stumbling upon us, It reeks of something more… calculated.”
Gaius remained silent for a moment, the only sound the rhythmic thwack of his sandals against the undergrowth. Finally, he spoke. “We press on for now, we have no other option. Ally or not, keep your eyes peeled, trust no one”
Suddenly, a flicker of movement from the dense foliage ahead shattered the rhythmic crunch of boots, followed by shouts and the unmistakable sound of arrows slicing through the air. A hail of feathered death erupted from the dense foliage flanking the path on either side, a move that sent a surge of adrenaline through me. Arrows whistled past my ear, some clattering harmlessly off shields or helmets, others finding their mark with sickening thuds.
Pandemonium erupted within the ranks. A legionnaire nearby crumpled to the ground, a feathered shaft protruding from his chest. Adrenaline pumping, my heart hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs. Aulus, his face grim and determined, slammed his shield into mine, and another legionnaire slammed his shield into both of us, then another, then another, forming a roof against the relentless arrow storm. We huddled together, other legionaries pressing in for a sliver of protection as the metallic clang of spear points deflecting off shields filled the air, a deafening counterpoint to the screams of the wounded and dying just outside our impulse testudo. The cries of pain and fear of this very moment reflected the very same ambush Lucius, my old friend, had fallen.
But unlike the previous ambush, the men didn't falter. weeks, mere weeks spent here, in this new world had honed us into a well-oiled war machine. Gaius, a seasoned veteran to the jungles at this point, roared a command that cut through the chaos. “Clear out the Xaltocans on each side, make sure we ambush them, not the other way around!”
Unlike the ambush that claimed Lucius, this time we were ready. The unorthodox two-line formation, going to work as the outer layer lowered shields and plunged straight into the undergrowth in a wave of steel. Aulus and I, along with the second rank, followed close behind, pilums or gladius fully drawn and extended, supporting our comrades close behind.
Just like that, within a blink of an eye, the entire formation split in two, each column charging towards their respective side, lunging towards the Xaltocans before they had the chance to lunge first, absolutely brilliant one might say.
The forest floor meanwhile, once muddy and damp, became a tangled mess of limbs and weapons as the two forces met in a brutal clash. The pungent smell of blood mingled with the earthy musk of the jungle, a sickening cocktail that threatened to overwhelm me. 
Nevertheless, we pressed forward, a tide of humanity fueled by fury and the desperate need for survival. My gladius felt slick in my hand, a weight both reassuring and terrifying. Aulus roared war cries beside me, his face in a mask of concentration before he swung his sword at a nearby warrior.
Despite the shock and unexpected turn we pulled, our initial charge met heavy resistance by the Xaltocans, hidden amongst the dense undergrowth, fought with a ferocity born of their own desperation. Their spears finding their mark with cries of pain erupting from the ranks surrounding me. The press of bodies was suffocating, the tangled foliage hampering our disciplined formations with terrifying ease.
Our advance slowly sputtered and eventually stalled, replaced by forced retreat back towards the spot where we had started our march. Just as despair began to creep in, a thundering roar came from behind us. Turning my head, I saw engineers, the very same ones who had argued viscously days ago, cranking a handful of catapults and mounted crossbows, silent harbingers of destruction, facing them straight towards the Xaltocan flanks as the hand of a catapult and the string of a crossbow clanks with each draw of a lever.
A primal fear then filled the eyes of the Xaltocan warriors. They knew the devastating power of these weapons, the hail of stones and bullets that could turn the tide of any battle. With a roar, they retreated backwards, vanishing into the thick foliage. We held our position, wary of their sudden withdrawal.
The moment of respite was short-lived. Just as we began to regroup, a storm of projectiles erupted from our lines. Stones and projectiles arced through the air, raining down on the positions the Xaltocans had recently stood. The thunderous booms seemed to shake the very ground beneath our feet.
But the Xaltocans were not fooled. They had anticipated this move. Their retreat was a calculated one since as soon as the last of the projectiles whizzed past, a deafening war cry rose from the forest depths and they surged out from the undergrowth once again, numbers unchanging and eyes burning with renewed fury. The brutal dance of death was far from over.
Instinct took over. Years of drilling hammered into muscle memory as we slammed our shields together, forming a wall. Aulus and I exchanged a grim look of understanding. This was it, The fight to end all fights, the battle to end all battles.
With a synchronized roar, we launched our pila, the javelins arcing through the air as some found their mark with cries of pain roaring from the Xaltocan ranks following suit. Then, with a suddenness of a bolt of lightning, the slam of clubs and spears against shields rang with a terrifying thud as the men in front were launched backwards from the Xaltocans' bid to dislodge our century.
The engineers were frantically clambering around the catapults, their movements frantic. The reload time, The Xaltocans might knew it too.
A roar then erupted from the dense foliage to our right. A band of Xaltocan warriors, unseen until now, emerged from the jungle, aiming to bypass our shield wall and attack the vulnerable engineers, dashing towards the helpless men as the band charged, slowly gaining speed as time passed on.
“Flanks!” Aulus bellowed, his voice raw with urgency. He pointed towards the unseen threat, his eyes wide with alarm. “They're flanking!”
My blood ran cold. The engineers scrambled, realizing the danger, but their movements were too slow. Panic, once contained, now on the brink of spilling-out, only exaggerated by the fact that Aulus was in no position to command anyone else but himself.
Knowing this all too well, Aulus, without hesitation, charged towards the incoming Xaltocans, a lone figure against a tide of warriors. His sword flashed in the dappled sunlight as I watched as Aulus fought with a desperate bravery that bordered on recklessness and the ferocity that bordered on lunacy.
“Aulus! What are you doing!?” I roared, “back in formation, Titus would go ballistic when he finds out!”
A strangled cry tore from my throat as I lunged for Aulus, blindsided by a primal urge to pull him back from the brink. But before my fingers could brush his arm, a high-pitched whine sliced through the air. An engineer, his face contorted in terror, pointed a frantic finger above the charging Xaltocan flank.
“Stones! Incoming!” he shrieked, his voice barely audible.
My gaze snapped backwards, just in time to witness a horrifying sight. The massive sling unleashed its deadly payload. A torrent of fist-sized stones, hurled with the force of giants, arced towards the Xaltocans and more worryingly straight for Aulus and me.
With a desperate yelp, I grabbed Aulus and threw myself to the ground, carrying Aulus with me as we dived straight for the earth with a movement so sudden it seemed to defy the earth's pull. The stones rained down around us, a deadly hail thudding against the dirt and scattering with bone-jarring thuds. A plume of dust rose from the earth around us, momentarily obscuring the whole world from view.
My breath hitched, fear choking the primal scream that threatened to erupt from my throat as I dragged a coughing, sputtering Aulus from the fray and into our lines and behind the catapult.
Aulus stumbled to his feet, his face a mask of soot and grit. He glanced at his narrowly missed demise, then at the stunned Xaltocans below, before letting out a roar that echoed through the trees.
“How do you like that!” he spat, voice laced with a fury that transcended fear. “Is this all you can muster? Bring it on!”
The hail of stones ceased as abruptly as it began. The Xaltocans, caught completely off guard, stood frozen for a moment, their momentum broken. Perhaps they realized the catapults are no single-shot war toys. With dozens of massive stones loaded on nearby catapults, its lethal potential emminated from the machine itself.
Exhaustion, already etched on the Xaltocan faces from their earlier charge, deepened into despair. They had gambled on a quick victory, hoping to overwhelm our defenses before the engineers could respond. Now, their gamble had backfired spectacularly. With a guttural roar, a Xaltocan warrior at the front turned and fled, his retreat echoing through the ranks like a wave.
As if a switch had been flipped, the entire Xaltocan force dissolved into chaos as a fresh new torrent of stone whizzed through the air. Their battle cries turned into panicked shrieks as they scrambled to retreat. Gaius, ever the opportunist, seized the moment.
“Legionaries!” he roared, his voice tinged with a predatory glint. “Capture what you can! Weakened prey is the easiest to catch!”
Our ranks then erupted into cheers as we surged forward, gladii flashing in the sunlight. The pursuit was a chaotic affair. Some Xaltocans, fueled by a desperate hope of escape, sprinted towards the safety of the jungle, only to be cut down by a hail of stones done by the catapults. Others, clearly spent, stumbled and fell, their roars of defiance turning into whimpers of surrender as legionaries descended upon them.
From the edge of the fray, Aulus and I spotted a lone Xaltocan warrior crumpled on the ground. Unmoving amidst the churned earth, a crimson stain bloomed on his chest where a stone had found its mark. Aulus nudged me with his elbow, a silent question hanging in the air.
With a curt nod, I fell into step beside him as we approached this downed Xaltocan warrior, a closer look reveals the warrior wasn't simply crumpled he writhed on the bloodstained earth, a massive welt marred his chest, courtesy of a catapult stone, and with each ragged breath, a strangled gurgling sound escaped his throat. His eyes, though, held a spark of something other than defeat, a desperate plea for mercy.
He locked eyes with Aulus, his own gaze flickering with a tint of recognition, a shared understanding of the brutal dance they'd both been forced into. A rasping cough tore from his lips, tinged with a bloody tang.
“Mercy,” he rasped, the word a mangled mess in his broken Latin. “No fight… me done” His voice, weak and wet with blood, held a tremor of fear that resonated deep within me. Pity, a rare visitor on the battlefield, tugged at my chest. This wasn't a hardened warrior, but a young man, barely older than Lucius, brought to his knees by the brutality of war.
Aulus hesitated, a sliver of unease flickering across his battle-hardened features. “Hands in the air,” he said, his voice tight. “I need to make sure you dont—”
But the words died in his throat as the Xaltocan warrior's plea for mercy abruptly morphed into a roar. He wasn't finished. With a burst of adrenaline that defied his obvious injuries, he lunged forward, a glint of something catching the sunlight.
The movement was so sudden, so unexpected, that for a heart-stopping moment, the world seemed to stand still. My own shock, raw and primal, died in my throat as my vision locked onto the glint of the dagger, wickedly barbed and aimed straight for Aulus' neck.
Aulus, caught completely off guard, stumbled back a step. But the dagger had found its mark and sank into his flesh, a crimson bloom blooming around the wound. A choked gasp escaped him, his eyes widening in shock and betrayal. The Xaltocan warrior reached out to deliver a final blow.
Fury, hot and blinding, surged through me. This wasn't a warrior fighting for his life; this was a cornered beast taking down my friend, my comrade, down to hell with him, this treacherous act, this petty act, shall cast a lifelong curse on the Xaltocans!
Xaltocan's earlier plea for mercy lingered in my mind, a cruel mockery in the face of his sudden betrayal. In that split second, the battlefield faded away. All I saw was Aulus, his hand clutching at the wound in his neck, and the glint of the dagger poised to strike him down. 
A roar ripped from my throat, a sound born of rage and a desperate need to protect my friend. My gladius, slick with the blood of another Xaltocan, whipped through the air in a blur. The world seemed to slow down, the tip of my blade finding its mark with a crunch to the Xaltocan warrior's chest, his eyes widened in surprise, his snarl morphing into a look of raw terror. The dagger clattered to the ground as he crumpled, his departure a whimper amidst the chaos of the battlefield.
But my victory felt hollow, the metallic tang of blood thick in my mouth. I ignored the traitorous Xaltocan at my feet, my gaze locked on Aulus, who had slumped on the ground.
"Aulus," I rasped, the word torn from my throat. My hand reached out, trembling, to grasp the air. His eyes, the same stormy gray that had seen countless battles by my side, flickered with a fading light.
He tried to speak, his lips moving silently. Desperation clawed at me. "Don't leave me, brother," I pleaded, the words thick with a despair I hadn't known I had. Aulus, my friend, my comrade, my brother, the only one who truly understood the burden we bore, was slipping away.
Then, his hand, once strong and steady, went limp. The light in his eyes flickered and died, leaving behind an empty shell. Aulus, my friend, my brother in arms, was gone.
I held him close, my world collapsing around me. The cheers of victory, the groans of the wounded, the tang of blood, all faded into nothingness. All I saw was Aulus, his face peaceful in death. He deserved a hero's death, a glorious end amidst the clash of steel. Instead, he died here, in the dirt, betrayed by a godless enemy, his death as unceremonious as the mud clinging to his boots.
Grief, a cold, heavy weight, settled in my chest, threatening to suffocate me. In that moment, amidst the carnage of the battlefield, I swore a silent oath. I would fight. I would fight for Lucius, for Aulus, for every soul who had lost to this senseless war.
But most of all, I would fight to survive. Not because I wanted to see my aging loved ones back home, but because as long as I drew breath, as long as I see the next sunrise, as long as I moved one foot in front of the other, their memory would live on.
The memory of Lucius, his booming laugh echoing through the cabin just a week ago, was a fresh wound torn open by Aulus' death. Two friends, gone in the blink of an eye. 
But they wouldn't have wanted me to succumb to despair. Aulus expected a brave soldier from me, Lucius expected a brave soldier from me, my mom expected a brave soldier from me, my dad expected a brave soldier from me, I wouldn't fall to my knees this time. They would have wanted me to fight, to live, to see this war through, to carry their memory on my shield. 
And so, I would fight. For Lucius. For Aulus. For every fallen comrade. I would fight. I would not let darkness consume me. I will see this campaign end.

Chapter XXIII

The muffled cheers of victory around me felt hollow, Aulus' lifeless body lay heavy in my arms just moments ago, the true cost of this "victory." As I lowered him gently to the ground, the scent of blood that still clung to the air. The Xaltocans, their once fierce charge broken by the hail of stones, had been routed. 
Exhausted but exhilarated, the legionaries slowly reformed their ranks, armor dented and bloodied, tending to the wounded with their swift movements while Others, their faces grim, carried the fallen to the side of the makeshift path being created. I watched with a cold detachment as a Xaltocan corpse, its face forever frozen in a final scream, was unceremoniously dragged away by a pair of legionaries. No reverence for the dead, no respect for their enemy. Just another obstacle to clear.
The sight only solidified the churning disgust churning in my gut. These weren't warriors fighting for a cause, not like Lucius or Aulus. They were savages, animals, driven by a primal bloodlust. They deserve no sympathy, no mercy. Every drop of their blood spilled on this battlefield was a debt repaid, a life balanced against the one so cruelly stolen from Aulus.
As the line for the prisoners began to form, Gaius materialized amongst us. A self-satisfied smirk played on his lips as nine ragged Xaltocan warriors were roughly shoved into his presence by a group of grinning legionaries. These were the spoils of war, the savage souls who hadn't been cut down in the heat of battle.
“Legionaries!” Gaius boomed, his voice hoarse but triumphant. “Today, you have shown the Xaltocans the true might of Rome! Now, claim your well-deserved rest. These Xaltocan dogs,” he gestured towards the prisoners with a sneer, “will be dealt with in no time.”
With a curt nod, the legionaries shuffled forward, their weariness evident in their slow movements. We formed a double line, facing each other, creating a makeshift corridor for the prisoners. As the Xaltocans were shoved forward, their faces were etched with a mix of defiance, fear, and despair. Some spat curses at us in their barbaric language, we grumbled threats in response. 
The exchange was a farce. Threats, empty promises of swift death, all meaningless. These beasts understood only one language: violence. And as I watched the defiance flicker in the Xaltocan's eyes, an urge to answer back in kind, to make him pay in blood and bone, surged through me.
But vengeance, while tempting, wouldn't bring Aulus back. No, I craved something more, something absolute.
Gaius beckoned the first prisoner forward. A legionary shoved the Xaltocan warrior towards him, his hand clamped on the back of his neck. Forcing the warrior to his knees before Gaius.
The stench of sweat and fear hit me. It was a sickening counterpoint to the memories that flooded my mind, memories of Aulus, vibrant and alive. Just moments before, the five-star resort that left my body contorted, the wise advice he gave after Lucius departed, the countless meals we cooked and the countless jokes we tossed. He wasn't just a friend, but a brother. The memory felt like a cruel mirage, a world away from the blood and mud that stained everything now.
Then there was the day we'd both been assigned latrine duty. Grueling, yes, but even that became an ordeal to be endured together. We'd spent the hours flinging insults and making bets on which unfortunate soul would slip and fall into the muck. Aulus, of course, had emerged victorious, leaving me to scrub the stench an extra hour.
The memories now felt like a physical ache in my chest. A constant reminder of what I'd lost, of the life that had been so carelessly snuffed out.
Gaius' voice boomed through the air with a sudden demand, his words harsh and demanding. The Xaltocan warrior, his face twisted in a mixture of defiance and fear, spat out a string of angry words in his barbaric tongue. The interpreter, a fellow with nervous eyes, stammered out the translation.
“He… he says they will not betray his people,” the interpreter squeaked. “They would rather die.”
A cold fury replaced the ache in my chest. They would rather die? They would rather see their entire tribe wiped out than face the consequences of their actions?
The injustice of it all, the sheer stupidity, fueled my growing resolve. I would find Yolotli, I would avenge Aulus, Yolotli wouldn't just be defeated; it would be utterly broken. Their tribe would be razed to the ground, anybody who harbored these savages would pay the ultimate price.
The, and only then would, perhaps, could I find some semblance of peace amidst the ruins of my memories. Only then could the ghost of Aulus, Lucius and the dozens, if not hundreds of others finally rest in peace.
Gaius, with a satisfied smirk, barked out another question, interrupting my thousand-pace stare. “What do they call this land they dare to steal from Rome?”
The interpreter's voice trembled as he relayed the question. The Xaltocan warrior, his defiance waning with every blow, rasped out a reply in broken latin, no, obliterated latin.
“Xaltocan” the warrior gruffed, “Land not tribe!,” Gaius Boomed, a hint of amusement flickering in his eyes. “These dogs don't know the difference it seems, well then,” Giaus paused, sweeping his gaze across the lined-up Xaltocans, “let's honor this land by the steel that will struck down these savages, mighty Vulcan, god of fire and the forge, i shall honor you, repay our debts to your blessings, and call this newfound land… Vulcannus.”
Gaius, with a flourish that seemed almost theatrical, drew his gladius and held it aloft. “A fitting name for a new land for rome! Now that I am satisfied with these savages, they will sing no more of their precious Yolotli” He commanded, and with a curt nod to a waiting centurion, the order was sealed.
A ripple of unease passed through the ranks, particularly among the newer recruits. Young faces paled as the reality of war sunk in. Back then, the violence had felt distant, a story told around campfires, embellished with forced bravery and heroism. Now, it was a brutal truth staring them back in the face.
For me, however, there was only slight satisfaction. These Xaltocans had chosen their fate. They wouldn't break, wouldn't simply give up the information we desperately need. Their deaths, while regrettable from a purely tactical standpoint, served as a grim reminder of the price they'd pay for daring to defy Rome.
The executions themselves were swift and devoid of ceremony. Legionaries moved amongst the prisoners with no elaborate gladiatorial display, no stretched torture. Just the swift, brutal finality of a gladius finding its mark, at least it's significantly more humane than what these barbarians might do to their captured romans.
I hefted my backpack and quickly fell into position in my century, since we bore the brunt of an assault, the century felt noticeably less prominent, a few helmets here, a few helmets there and Aulus, peace be with him. When Gaius barked the order to move out, the men suddenly marched with the efficiency of a well-oiled machine.
My steps, normally burdened with the weight of steel, wood and anticipation, felt lighter this time, definitely not with the thrill of victory, but something else akin to a cold resolve. Yolotli awaited. 
Pushing my commentary aside for the moment, I quickened my pace, falling into step beside a veteran with a network of scars etched across his face. “How far is Yolotli?” I rasped, my voice hoarse from the dust and the weight of the day's events.
The veteran grunted, his voice low and gravelly. “Probably two days' march, give or take. Keep your head down sonny, and your gladius close.”
Two days. Two days until I would stand before the very heart of the Xaltocan menace. One day until I could finally lay Aulus' spirit to rest. The road ahead would be long and bloody, but I would see it through. For Aulus. For Rome. And for whatever shred of humanity I still clung to in the face of this consuming darkness.
The rhythmic crunch of boots on packed earth became a monotonous soundtrack in my ears and as minutes bled into hours, the sun slowly began to sink over the treeline, the world around me began to glow in hues of red and orange as the fiery ball of the heavens we moved across the sky.
Despite the beautiful scenery that's about to unfold, the men, usually riddled with chatter and conversation now replaced by a thick slab of silence that screamed louder than any battle cry any mortal could muster. It screamed of empty spaces in the formation, gaps that had once been filled by the boisterous laughter of Aulus and countless others. It screamed of an unspoken sorrow that clung to our ears.
Every rustle in the nearby brush, every fleeting shadow cast by a passing cloud, casts a nervous chill through me. Half expected, half dreading, I imagined Xaltocan scouts lurking just beyond our sight, waiting to ambush this weakened cohorts burdened by its losses. 
But the only enemy that came out of these shadows was the near-constant, ache in my chest. It was a hollowness that no amount of marching or the comforting weight of my gladius could fill.
Memories filled my mind, Aulus, his face flushed with exertion after a particularly grueling training session, throwing his arm around my shoulder and roaring with laughter. Aulus, his brow furrowed in concentration as he carried me back to camp, after an arrow found its mark on my shoulder. Aulus, his eyes shining with disbelief as we spotted a sliver of land after weeks in the ocean all those months ago.
With every step, the ache intensified. But weakness, even a moment of it, was a luxury I couldn't afford. Not while Yolotli stood, a fortress, a monument honoring the very same savages that had taken Aulus from this realm. Not now, not while the flames of vengeance still burned so fiercely within.
The relentless march towards oblivion continued nonetheless, ignorant and uncaring for anything, only answering to the path, but the road to Yolotli stretched on, a path paved with blood and loss. 
In the distance, a solitary hill nudged against the darkening sky. The ache in my chest, a constant companion for the past day's march intensified as I stared at the setting sun. Aulus and his spirit burns bright as the sun throughout our time in the battlefield, shining hope and a reason to fight another day, guiding my journey through the dark forest after Lucius' passing, guiding me and shining the path ahead bright and clear. But, just like the sun, it has to fade, it has to sink, and bringing along with it, was the light that shines, slowly condemning the world into eternal darkness, but this time, there was no second sunrise.
The thought brought a fresh wave of grief, a tide threatening to pull me under. The thought had casted a spell on me, a terrine spell that morphed the most mundane things into herculean tasks without him by my side. As I began the familiar routine of digging a shallow trench, the earth felt heavier than usual, my movements sluggish and uncoordinated. The rhythmic bite of the shovel against the dirt rang with a hollowness that mirrored the emptiness within me.
Aulus, with his boundless energy, would have finished the trench in half the time, his booming laughter filling the air as he playfully challenged me to a race. Now, silence reigned, broken only by the grunts of the men around me and the heavy thud of metal on stone. Even the camaraderie, the shared purpose that usually bound us together as one army seems strained, forever tinged by raw grief clinging to us with its unwavering claws.
Around the makeshift camp, the familiar pre-battle rituals unfolded, sharpening blades, cleaning armor, sharing meager rations in hushed tones. Yet, a spark seemed missing from the usual preparations. The nervous energy before most engagements had been replaced by a heavy resignation, a dull acceptance of the inevitable bloodshed to come.
Yet, as the sun starts to condemn the world into darkness, vengeance, the flame that refuses to be snuffed out offered its light, shining the path ahead, offering its own reason to fight, offering its courage
With a heavy sigh, I rose to my feet, the weight of my armor, my gladius, and the crushing weight of loss threatening to drag me down. Looking up at the star-dusted mosaic of the night sky, I whispered a silent prayer to the moon. Grant me strength, I pleaded, the strength to see this through, the strength to find solace amidst the storm. But most of all, grant me the clarity to see if this path, this insatiable hunger for vengeance, truly honored the memory of the man I called brother, please, Luna, goddess of the mood, daughter of Hyperion and Theia.
Gaius' booming voice shattered the settling quiet of the camp, something I'd gotten used to by now, the only thing I got used to. “Legionaries! Gather around for a final briefing before we bed down for the night.”
The men grumbled amongst themselves, their movements sluggish with exhaustion, but shuffled towards Gaius regardless. His announcement was brief and grim. “Tomorrow,” he declared, his voice laced with a predatory glint, “we march for the better part of the day. By nightfall, we will be within striking distance of Yolotli. Be prepared. The Xaltocans will fight for their lives, but remember, Rome's glory is on the line!”
A ripple of nervous energy passed through the ranks, a stark contrast to the heavy silence that had dominated the evening. Some faces, particularly those of the newer recruits, were pale and drawn, their eyes wide with anticipation. But most wore a hardened mask of determination, the mask of men who had stared into the abyss and found only the reflection of their own mortality staring back.
With a curt dismissal, Gaius dissolved the assembly. The night unfolded with a predictable routine, hurried meals of cold rations, whispered conversations, and the ever-present clinking of armor as men settled into their makeshift beds that is their shields and bags.
Rising with a groan, I shouldered my pack and made my way towards the rest of the men. The scene, per usual, mirrored the same one on that hill yesterday's night. As I reached a decent spot, a familiar impulse sparked within me.
“That spot looks fine enough, right Aulus?” I mumbled, turning to my left, the spot where my friend usually sat, ready with a witty remark or a playful insult. Now… The words hung heavy in the air, returning a deafening silence.
Right. Aulus. Dead.
Sinking down onto the rough earth, I tossed my shield at an empty patch of dirt, tossing my bag and entrenching tools beside.
Laying down beneath the dim light of the moon alongside slumbering legionnaires felt surreal, wrapping my arms around myself, i scanned the stars, looking for… something, anything to distract me from reality, the stars, like a million dots in a vast tapestry, twinkled down at me, indifferent to the human tragedy unfolding beneath while here we were, embroiled in this bloody mess of war, pawns in a game of power far grander than ourselves. Lives snuffed out like dying embers, replaced by new recruits just as eager, just as naive. Up there, though, the stars simply existed.
No clash of steel, no screams of the dying, no weight of vengeance clinging to their celestial forms. They shine, unchanging, simple lights that cared nothing for the petty squabbles and bloodshed that consumed our world.
My eyelids grew heavy, the weight of the day's march pressing down on me. The urgency of vengeance, so sharp just moments ago, dulled at the edges. Maybe, for just a few hours, sleep would offer a reprieve, a refuge from reality that awaits at dawn.

Chapter XXIV

The insistent clatter of pots and pans against hardened leather ripped me from a restless sleep. Dawn, a pale sliver on the horizon, cast an unwelcome light across the makeshift camp. Groans and muttered curses echoed around me as the men stirred awake, another day, another bloody campaign stretching before us like a desolate wasteland.
I stretched, the familiar ache in my muscles dull compared to the hollowness that had taken root within. Aulus' absence was a constant ache that no amount of sleep could ever fill. 
As the remnants of last night's sleep smoldered. I rose and knelt beside my pack, the chill of the air biting through my tunic. Pushing myself to my feet, I moved my fingers to unbuckle my pack. Inside, nestled amongst the usual rations and entrenching tools, lay a worn leather pouch, I untied the cord and withdrew its contents, a small, intricately carved wooden figurine.
It was a crude thing, a token carved by my parents back home, a small thing, given out when I was barely a teen, signing up for the military.
With a heavy sigh, I returned the figurine to its pouch and secured it within my pack. It was a small ritual, a moment of quiet reflection before the storm. Only then did I turn to the more practical aspects of the day.
I wore a fresh undergarment stuffed inside my sack, the rough fabric a harsh contrast to the lingering warmth of my sleep. Next came the greaves, then my lorica segmentata, each piece carefully adjusted and secured.
Finally, I strapped on my gladius, the weight of the short sword a familiar comfort in my hand. Each movement was deliberate, focused, a silent tribute to the fallen and a preparation for the fight to come.
I rummaged through my pack for a final item. Tucked into a corner, nestled amongst the usual rations of hard bread and dried fruit, was the strange pod I and Aulus struggled with on that hill. A gift from the lands to the south and from our ally. 
Until now, I had eaten this thing raw, it wasn't good for sure, it was edible, but perhaps it was meant to be boiled, or roasted in the fire? Here I was, a trained legionnaire, yet utterly defeated by a simple piece of food I had eaten literally yesterday.
Peeling back the husk, I nearly dropped the pod before I managed to pull the native's tactic, revealing the row of golden kernels inside, like the native demonstrated, i took a bite out of the thing, scraping away the golden pods as i shouldered my pack, with a final glance at the trees, I set out towards my century, the strange taste of the pod lingering on my tongue, a small reminder of a world beyond the battlefield.
With my pack secured and the strange taste of the pod fading on my tongue, I joined the regrouping of my century. The familiar faces, etched with fatigue and the grim reality of the coming battle, offered a cold comfort. 
My gaze darted amongst the ranks, searching for a familiar face, someone to share the crushing weight of grief with, someone to hold me anchor, someone to give me a little nudge through this thick bog I'm in. Yet, the men around me were busy with their own preparations, their faces masks of determination. A sense of isolation washed over, I was truly alone.
Suddenly, a thought struck me. Titus. He had probably witnessed countless bonds, countless lives, and perhaps, maybe Aulus' too. Maybe he could offer a sliver of solace, a word of advice to navigate this storm.
Spotting him across the crowd, I strode towards him, my steps heavy with purpose. Titus, a man weathered by countless battles, looked up from sharpening his gladius. A flicker of understanding crossed his face as our eyes met.
“Titus,” I began, my voice rough with emotion, “about Aulus…”
He didn't need me to finish the sentence. With a curt nod, he gestured for me to sit beside him on a fallen log. We sat in silence for a moment, the only sound the murmur of the legion preparing for battle.
Then, Titus spoke, his voice gravelly but laced with quiet wisdom. “Loss is a wound, Marcus,” he said, his gaze fixed on a distant point. “It will scar you, but with time, it will heal. Aulus wouldn't want you to drown in grief. Honor him by fighting with courage, by fighting with the same life he embodied.”
His words were simple, but they struck a chord within. Just then, Gaius' booming voice shattered the silence. “Legionnaires! Form up!”
We rose, a wave of steel and wood washing over the earth. As the men formed into-place and marched forward towards Yolotli, the image of Aulus, the image of Lucius, face bright with joy and courage, flashed in my mind. I gripped the hilt of my gladius, a silent vow forming on my lips. “I won't let you down, both of you.”
The rhythmic crunch of boots on packed earth rang in my ears as we marched. Titus' words lingered in my mind, a mere sentence against the rising tide of grief. Neither Aulus or Lucius wanted me consumed by vengeance, they'd want me to live, to carry a spark of their spirit. Yet, the memory of Aulus' lifeless form, Lucsius' lifeless form, etched against the backdrop of the battlefield, remained a raw wound. Every step felt heavy, every breath a struggle against the crushing weight of loss.
Suddenly, a sharp crackle of voices pierced the monotonous drone of marching feet. It came from a group of officers gathered around Gaius, their polished armor gleaming in the morning sun. Driven by a morbid curiosity, I shifted closer, catching snippets of their conversation.
“...a decisive victory,” Gaius' voice boomed, laced with self-assured arrogance. “We sent those Xaltocan savages scurrying back to their holes. A message sent loud and clear!”
A chorus of agreement followed. My stomach clenched. Victory? They called the brutal ambush a victory? Visions of Aulus, his lifeblood staining the dusty earth, flooded my mind. Was his life, and the lives of countless others, just a statistic in their self-serving narrative?
Then, a casually tossed-off remark sent a surge of fury through me. “...lost a good fifty or so men, a small price to pay for victory, wouldn't you agree, Septimus?”
Fifty men. A number tossed around like a bag of coins. Fifty souls, each with a life, a family, a story. Reduced to a mere footnote in their eyes. This wasn't the first time. Lucius, a vibrant young recruit full of life, became just another number the day an arrow found its mark. Now, Aulus. And fifty more.
These men, these officers who spoke of victory while feasting on stolen rations, had never seen the battlefield up close. Yes, Gaius, and the others were there during the engagement, but were they truly there? Were they truly present? Were they in the moment? They hadn't witnessed the terror in a soldier's eyes as he faced his enemy, or the agonizing screams of the wounded left to die on the battlefield. They had not witnessed any, just numbers on scrolls and cubes on a map.
The anger that had flared within me at Gaius' words burned hot, but fuming silently wouldn't change a thing. With a clenched jaw, I tore myself away from the conversation, the metallic clang of their gladius against their armor a jarring counterpoint to the rhythmic crunch of boots on earth.
Needing a distraction, I focused on the legionaries marching directly behind me. Their faces, etched with fatigue and the ever-present shadow of loss, were a stark contrast to the self-assured arrogance of the officers.
A snippet of conversation drifted back to me, carried on the warm breeze. “Think we'll breach their walls once we arrive” a young recruit said, his voice laced with a nervous hope.
Beside him, a grizzled veteran chuckled, the sound dry and humorless. “Breach the walls, lad, we will. But breaching the walls ain't the same as winning a war. Remember yesterday? Took a village, but those damned Xaltocans just melted back into the hills like ghosts.”
The young recruit's hopeful expression faltered, replaced by a flicker of worry. “So, what then? Another slog through the mountains, chasing shadows?”
The veteran shrugged, a weary gesture. “Who knows, lad. Who knows. But one thing's for certain, we fight for glory, they fight for their homes. Makes you wonder sometimes, doesn't it?”
Another voice chimed in, a man with a thick beard and a twinkle in his eye despite the grim circumstances. “All I know is, if we do take Yolotli, I'm finding the biggest tavern in town and celebrating for a week straight. Wine, women, and song – the finer things in life, wouldn't you agree?”
“Sounds like a plan, Caius,” another replied, voice hoarse. “Just make sure you save me a seat.”
These men, with their dreams and anxieties, were just expendable pawns in Gaius' eyes. Fathers, sons, brothers, bound together by a shared experience, a shared fear, and a sliver of hope for a life beyond the battlefield.
The relentless sun beat down on our backs as we marched, each step a testament to the wearying slog of war. Hours, or perhaps it was just the monotony, blurred together. My anger towards Gaius simmered beneath the surface, fueled by the conversations I'd overheard. But duty calls, and emperor Decius still looms overhead, despite the worlds we are from Rome.
Suddenly, a flurry of activity erupted at the front of the column. Scouts bolted and huddled with Gaius, their voices urgent and hushed. A tense silence fell over the men as we waited for news. Finally, Gaius turned, his face a mask of predatory anticipation.
“Legionnaires!” His voice boomed, crackling with authority. “Word from our scouts! An Xaltocan outpost lies ahead, a mere thorn in our path to Yolotli!”
The prospect of a fight, a chance to test their mettle and perhaps even claim some spoils, sparked a flicker of life in their tired eyes.
Gaius, sensing the shift in mood, continued. “Our esteemed engineers will proceed ahead and prepare their weapons. Let them soften the enemy's defenses while we rest and prepare for a swift conquest. Remember, this is a mere outpost, a stepping stone on our glorious march to victory!”
While some bursted into a fiery inferno at the prospect of battle, others exchanged glances. The memory of the recent ambush, disguised as a victory by Gaius, was still fresh in their minds. This “outpost” might not be the pushover it seemed.
As Gaius barked orders, the engineers, a motley crew of gruff men and their cumbersome machines, detached from the main column. They lumbered towards the front, their war toys lumbering like monstrous beasts on leashes.
The engineers, like lumbering giants, came to a halt just outside my sight ahead. With practiced efficiency, they began assembling their weapons, rams, catapults and mounted crossbows. They all assembled them just a few hundred paces ahead of the force.
Gaius, a cruel smile twisting his lips, raised a hand for silence. “Engineers!” he bellowed, his voice echoing across the now-still legion. “Unleash your fury! Let those Xaltocan dogs know the wrath of Rome! Show them no mercy!”
The engineers give Gaius a mere thumbs up, but one that unleashed whatever they had put on the catapults, a sudden, deafening SNAP! The first catapult launched its projectile. We couldn't see the impact yet, the Xaltocan outpost still obscured by a rise of a hill ahead. But a plume of dust erupting into the sky betrayed the target.
Another SNAP! sent a second stone hurtling skyward, followed by another, and another. The rhythmic thunder of the catapult launches became a relentless drumbeat, punctuated by the distant thumps of impacts echoing off the unseen walls. The engineers, their movements a well-rehearsed dance of muscle and sweat, fed the hungry machines a steady diet of destruction.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity of bombardment, the crest of the hill dipped, and the Xaltocan outpost came into view. It wasn't the grand fortress I'd envisioned, but a squat, square structure of smooth stone, its single gate already splintered and smoking from the relentless hail of stone.
Gaius, ever the opportunist, seized the moment. “Legionnaires! Form up!” His voice, amplified by the natural acoustics of the valley, boomed across the ranks. A ripple of movement surged through the legion as we fell into a testudo, ready to face the Xaltocan response.
My gaze locked on the remaining Xaltocan defenders scrambling atop the ramparts. Their numbers were depleted, their movements frantic. But in their eyes, I saw a defiance that mirrored my own. This wouldn't be an easy victory. But by Jupiter, we would have it. For Aulus. For Lucius And for Rome.
The engineers, with a final grunt, launched their last volley of stones and arrows. The projectiles arced and descended into the fort, punctuated by the satisfying thumps of boulders finding their mark. Dust plumes rose from the battered fort, momentarily obscuring the Xaltocan defenders.
Then we waited, waited for the volley of obsidian death, the volley of arrows that will rain down at any moment. We waited for the inevitable clicking and thumping of arrows against shields, we waited, we knew it would arrive, we knew it all too well.

Chapter XXV

We waited and waited, bracing ourselves for the onslaught that never came. The dust settled, revealing the tattered remains of the outpost walls, but no rain of arrows pierced the silence. Confusion ripped through the ranks, a wrinkle in the carefully planned rhythm.
Gaius scanned the silent fort. “Cowards!” he roared, voice laced with cruel amusement. “The Xaltocan dogs cower behind their broken walls! Legionnaires! Show them the true meaning of Roman courage! To the gates!”
A cheer then rose from the men, a roar fueled by the promise of an easy victory. Gaius' booming voice seemed accurate. No hail of arrows, no charges, just silence.
Vengeance, a tightly coiled serpent within me, uncoiled further. This wasn't the glorious battle I envisioned, facing a horde of Xaltocan warriors. But it was an opportunity regardless, a chance to unleash the bottled-up rage that had consumed me since Aulus' death. Luna, with her infinite power and might, my majesty had granted my pleas.
With renewed purpose, I fell into step with my century, the rhythmic crunch of boots on packed earth a steady counterpoint to the pounding of my heart. The battered gate of the fort loomed ahead, a gaping wound in the once-defiant wall. Beside me, my comrades shared a mix of anticipation and unease in their eyes. Even the prospect of an easy victory held an unsettling undercurrent.
The engineers, ever efficient, had positioned their battering ram, a monstrous log tipped with iron before the shattered gate. With a chorus of grunts and heaves, they slammed the ram into the wood. The impact shaking the very walls of the fort
Another blow, and another, and another, each one tearing away at the remaining timbers. The final blow came with a deafening crack, sending the shattered remains of the gate flying inwards. 
The moment of truth had arrived. With a deep breath, I adjusted my grip on my gladius, the familiar weight a source of comfort amidst the swirling emotions. 
With a battle cry that rippled through the ranks, we surged forward towards the gate as one, one tide of steel and crimson red. The storm, long brewing within me, had finally broken, and I was ready to unleash its fury upon the Xaltocans within the fort.
The roar of the men surged behind me as we flooded through the shattered gate. I braced myself for a desperate fight, my gladius held high. Ready for the hail of arrows or the thrusts of a spear, but the scene that greeted us was far from the brutal clash I'd envisioned.
Instead of ferocious warriors, the fort's dusty courtyard was littered with figures hunched over in misery. Some with wounds from the catapult's torrent of stones while others bore wounds of something else.
These weren't the enemies I'd expected to face, not a disease-ridden horde, but men reduced to shadows. A sense of satisfaction, the dark thrill of seeing the Xaltocans brought low, sent a ripple through my spine. 
The orange-ish dots, morbid constellations mapped onto their skin fueled my confusion. They were a clue, a piece of a puzzle I desperately wanted to solve. What was this? What did it mean for us, the Roman army, standing in front of this silent enemy?
The courtyard, once a potential battlefield, now felt like a desolate expanse of packed dirt. The groans of the warriors echoed around me. 
Yet, a sliver of gratitude flashed for a brief moment within. Perhaps the gods, in their own way, had heard my pleas. Not for a glorious victory drenched in blood, but for a swift end to this brutal campaign. This wasn't the vengeance I'd envisioned, but it was a victory nonetheless. A victory secured not by might, but by a silent curse that befell of the Xaltocans.
“There's two gates! Seems like these Xaltocans led as soon as the hail of stone came!” a legionary sounded, he pointed towards a gaping gate, wide open, flung outwards, suggesting a rushed retreat.
Gaius, however, remained unmoved. “Loot what you can!” he boomed, his voice shattering in the quiet that descended. The promise of plunder snapped the men out of its silence. Men swarmed the unguarded barracks, grabbing whatever they could find, sacks of grain, dried meat, even a few folds of bandages.
My gaze, scanning the desolate courtyard, scanning for a house that looked promising, but most structures are either empty by now, or in the process of emptying out, then, just as I was about to turn around, my gaze landed on an imposing structure at the far end. Unlike the ramshackle barracks, it was built of smooth, polished stone, a pyramid with steps on each side of a structure, leading to a flat top with a single altar in the center. A temple, perhaps, dedicated to some Xaltocan deity.
But what truly sent a jolt through me was the sight of a crimson stain spreading down the steps leading to the ground. Drying blood. In this fort of the sick and dying, violence had occurred. There was possibly more to this story than met the eye.
Ignoring the frenzy of looting around me, I quickened my pace towards the structure, my curiosity morphing into a steely resolve as I slowly approached the structure. The stench of death grows stronger as I approach the structure, a grim counterpoint to the groans of the afflicted. What happened? And who was responsible for the blood staining the steps? 
As I pressed on towards the imposing temple at the far end of the courtyard, a sense of unease settled over me. Unlike the ramshackle barracks, this structure was a monument to a different kind of power.
Carved into the smooth, polished stone walls were intricate figures, stylized serpents with wings, circles with faces and warriors with elongated limbs. An alien language, a series of twisting symbols that resembled nothing from any alphabet I recognized, snaked alongside the figures. These figures, deities even, looked awfully similar to a temple's carvings days ago during my pass through an abandoned village
The scene surrounding me wasn't any better either. Bones litter the packed dirt surrounding this structure, as I paced around the monument, every side, save for the back, seemed to hint of flowing blood and discarded bones, sheep or pig perhaps, offered up to appease their war god. Fair enough, back in Rome, Mars blesses and purifies our land with the souls of a few sheep and cattle.
Yet, as I scanned the scene more closely, the bones of whatever these Xaltocans were offering were scattered haphazardly, some lying near the bottom of the steps leading up to the altar at the far end of the temple.
The very idea of dragging an animal up those steep steps, let alone multiple ones, for a sacrifice seemed impractical to the point of absurdity. 
My brow furrowed as I scrutinized the scattered bones, their whiteness a jarring contrast against the bloodstained floor. The inscription on the walls, the strange offerings, the figures, it all merged into a picture I couldn't quite grasp. Lost in my own thoughts, I barely registered the clatter of footsteps behind me.
“Marcus? What are you doing?” Titus's voice, laced with a hint of unease, startled me out of my thoughts.
“Just taking a look around,” I muttered, rising to my feet. “This place gives me a bad feeling.”
He gave me a glance, his usual stoicism dimmed. “Still thinking about Aulus and Lucius?”
I sighed, the memory of my fallen friends a constant ache in my chest. “Of course I am. But this... this is different.”
“Don't get lost in your thoughts, we still have a long way to go until Yolotli my friend” Titus remarked, stretching his arms before turning around and pacing away.
Before I could elaborate, Titus let out a surprised noise, I turned around to see what could possibly cause the veteran to yelp, then, I saw Titus, face lit with excitement. “Look at this! Spoils of war, Marcus! My worn-out armor feels like it weighs a ton. This beauty here, though…” He hefted a gleaming breastplate, its surface polished to a mirror shine.
He had stumbled upon a pile of discarded armor near the back of the temple, a motley collection of dented helmets and scratched breastplates, some bearing the familiar insignia of a legionary.
The realization slammed into me with the force of a battering ram. The blood staining the steps, the scattered bones, the stench of death that clung to the air, it all painted a horrifying picture. A picture I desperately wanted to deny, but the only other explanation defied logic.
These Xaltocans, weakened by disease as they were, had done the unforgivable, had done the ultimate sin, had done the very barbarity we prided ourselves on rejecting. The discarded Roman armor, the haphazardly strewn bones, the blood. 
An act so barbaric, so utterly devoid of any shred of decency, that it defied comprehension. And yet dare they do this in front of the gods, mocking them with their… no, they deserved less, they deserved nothing more.
This wasn't just about Aulus or Lucius anymore. This was bigger. This was about drawing a line in the sand. Yolotli, once a mere military campaign, now took on the weight of a crusade. A crusade of civilization against barbarity, of the enlightened Roman ways against the bloodthirsty practices of these savages. It was about every innocent life snuffed out on these bloodstained steps. It was about showing the Xaltocans, and the world, the true meaning of justice.
We weren't just fighting for land and glory. At Least, I'm not. We were fighting for the very soul of this land, for the gods who witness such atrocities. We were fighting for Rome, for the gods, for the ideals that separated us apart from the barbarians who surrounded us.
This wasn't just a war. This was a cleansing fire. Yolotli would fall, not just for Rome, but for the gods, for Aulus, and for every soul who had perished within these cursed walls. This, I swore to myself, was only the beginning.
Fueled by a righteous fury, I stormed out of the scene, my boots echoing a rhythm against the dusty courtyard. Gaius, barking orders to his men amidst the ransacked fort, looked up at my approach, his brow furrowed in irritation.
“Marcus,” he snapped, “report. Spill everything”
Ignoring his brusque tone, I met his gaze with a steely glint on my own. “Something far worse than Xaltocan warriors, Gaius. We stumbled upon a scene of... unspeakable barbarity.”
A flicker of morbid curiosity sparked in his eyes. “Barbarity? Explain yourself.”
“The Xaltocans,” I began, my voice tight with controlled rage, “they weren't just ravaged by disease. They practiced sacrifice of a different kind.” I recounted the details, the blood staining the steps, the scattered bones, the discarded Roman armor, painting a vivid picture of the horrors I had witnessed.
Gaius's face drained of color, his usual arrogance replaced by a mask of stunned disbelief. “Here? In the heart of Xaltocan territory?”
“The evidence is undeniable,” I pressed on, guiding Gaius towards the very temple itself, my voice rising with every word. “The bones, the blood, the very layout of the temple. Our own men, captured perhaps, offered up to their gods.”
The revelation clung to Gaius, a dark cloud settling over his head. The celebratory shouts of the legionaries looting the fort began to be muffled as the both of us reveled in disgust. Gaius, his face grim, scanned the men, his gaze lingering on the plunder-laden soldiers.
“Legionnaires!” he bellowed, his voice echoing off the temple walls. “Assemble here, now! We have much to talk about!”
As the men scrambled to obey, their faces etched with a mixture of confusion and unease, a cold satisfaction settled within me. The truth, however horrifying, had been brought to light. Now, with Gaius forced to acknowledge the Xaltocans' barbarity, perhaps this war would take on a new meaning. Perhaps, just perhaps, the conquest of Yolotli wouldn't just be a bloody power grab, but a crusade against savagery.
Silence descended upon the courtyard as Gaius, his face a mask of thunderous fury, stood atop the temple steps, silhouetted against the setting sun.
With a voice that bursted in a fiery storm, he addressed the assembled legionnaires. “Legionaries of Rome! I stand before you today not just as your commander, but as a witness to a horror that would shame the very realm of Hades!”
“Marcus,” Gaius continued, his voice low and dangerous, “has uncovered a truth so foul, so utterly barbaric, these savages we have come to conquer deserved nothing but eternal damnation!”
A murmur of disgust and outrage rose from the legion. The revelation, a grim echo of what I had witnessed within the temple, ignited a firestorm of indignation within their ranks.
“They have spilled the blood of innocents on these very steps!” Gaius roared, his voice reaching a fever pitch. “They have defied the gods, the very fabric of civilization, with this savagery!”
He gestured towards the temple, its walls bathed in the crimson glow of the setting sun now seemed dripping with a new kind of horror. “This is not just about conquest, not just about new provinces to the empire. This is about bringing civilization to the dark corners of this world! These dogs had spat on the god's faces, and it is our duty, as enlightened Romans, to avenge our majesty!”
A roar then erupted from the men, a roar of agreement that shook the very foundations of the temple. The sight, the raw emotion etched on the faces of my comrades, sent a surge of both pride and a steely resolve. 
The fervor Gaius whipped up in the legion was undeniable. Cheers still ringing in my ears, a promise of vengeance that both fueled the burning flame within. 
As the last rays of sun dipped below the horizon, casting the Xaltocan fort in twilight, Gaius barked orders. “Set up camp in the nearby forest! These crumbling walls offer no protection from any attacks.” The legionnaires, their faces etched with a mixture of righteous fervor and grim acceptance, scurried to obey.
With a curt nod of dismissal, Gaius turned to address his officers. The crowd dispersed, their sandals crunching on the dusty ground as they marched towards the treeline. I lingered behind, before I could follow, Gaius placed a heavy hand on my shoulder.
“Marcus,” he rumbled, his voice gruff but laced with a grudging respect. “A keen eye you have. Uncovering that barbarity within the temple… it shifted the tide of this campaign.”
I met his gaze, surprised by the uncharacteristic praise. “I simply did my duty, sir.”
He snorted, an emotionless sound. “Duty, perhaps. But some duties require a sharper mind than most possess. Keep that mind sharp, Marcus. We may need it in the days to come.”
With a curt nod, Gaius turned and strode towards the other commanders, his silhouette swallowed by the growing darkness. 
Shouldering a shovel, I followed the men towards the trees. The air, thick with the scent of wood and damp earth, felt heavy with unspoken secrets. The fort loomed behind us, a silhouette against the orange sky. 

Chapter XXVI

A symphony of clanging pots and pans roused me awake. Cling clang cling clang, it never gets old. Sunlight, pale and bright, filtered through the canopy overhead, casting dappled shadows across my face. Groans and yawns filled the makeshift camp as men stirred from slumber, stretching stiff muscles and muttering curses under their breath. The crisp morning air, laced with the earthy scent of wood and soil, was a welcome change from the stale, blood-tinged atmosphere of the Xaltocan fort.
Sitting up, I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and surveyed the scene. Legionnaires shuffled about, preparing their morning meals. Smoke curled skyward from the fires, promising warmth and a much-needed breakfast. Yesterday's revelation, the discovery of barbarity within the Xaltocan temple, still feels fresh in my mind.
Some men, their eyes wide and faces drawn, spoke in hushed tones, glancing nervously towards the dark bulk of the fort that loomed behind us. Sleeping in the shadow of a place stained by such barbarity clearly unsettled them. 
“Did you hear about the markings on the walls? Demons they say, with wings and fangs!” a legionnaire blurted to his neighbor, voice just louder above a whisper.
“Aye,” the other replied, his brow furrowed. “And those bones... sacrificed to appease their gods. Makes you wonder what other horrors they practice in those dark places.”
Shaking my head at their fanciful stories, I rose to my feet. The discovery was horrifying enough without whispers of winged demons. But the underlying fear was undeniable. It still doesn't excuse their mumblings about “spirits” and “ghosts” they droned on and on about last night.
A cold resolve settled in my gut. This crusade felt more necessary now than ever. We were fighting to bring an end to such savagery. Aulus's face flashed in my mind, his memory a burning scar fueling my determination.
Reaching for my waterskin, I took a long swig, the cool liquid momentarily banishing the phantoms of the night. 
As I stood there, the murmur of the legion washing over me, I reached into my bag for my usual breakfast, a handful of green pods. In just three days, these things had become a familiar part of my diet. Sure, it's not the best, but they were filling and that was all that mattered, a fact I was increasingly grateful for. Popping the pod into my mouth, I chewed with forced enthusiasm, the bitter, fibrous texture reminding me of the long road ahead.
Shouldering my pack, I adjusted the weight of my gladius on my hip and the familiar weight of my bronze breastplate. The morning chill still lingered in the air, a stark contrast to the humid heat that usually settled over these lands by midday. Today, we were to resume our march, pushing deeper into Xaltocan territory. 
Finding Titus, once a tedious task, felt easy today, possibly by his newfound treasure that is his breastplate he snatched from the ground, which is just riddled with the unresting soul of the unfortunate legionnaire meeting a barbaric end. 
Regardless, I swooped into position, waiting around while Gaius stood around a group of higher-ups, his face grim beneath his crested helmet. His voice, though hoarse, rang out with authority as he addressed the assembled men. He spoke the usual eternity of a march towards Yolotli.
But his words, unlike yesterday's speech, failed to ignite the same fiery spirit in the legionnaires' eyes. Yet, a steely resolve burned within me. We were on a crusade, a mission for the gods themselves. And no matter the cost, we would see it through.
With a final, booming order from Gaius, the men began to move. The rhythmic crunch of sandals on packed earth rang through the trees, a steady sound that accompanied the chirping of unseen birds. I fell into step alongside my comrades. 
The dense forest canopy overhead offered little respite from the sun overhead, casting our helmets in a dappled gloom. As the usual drumbeat of sandals on the dirt rang through, i couldn't help but listen to the sound drowned out by our machine-like rhythm, our unnatural steady beat against the free and chaotic nature around us, the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves and the calls of animals never been seen before. Gone was the wonder I once felt for the wilderness, gone were the relaxing feel of nature's symphony. Now replaced by the lingering spirit and the haunting memories of Lucius, Aulus, and many, many more brothers.
The rhythmic crunch of footsteps, the low murmur of conversation that usually served as a comforting background, now grated my nerves. I tried focusing on anything else, the way sunlight speared through the leaves, casting fleeting diamonds on the forest floor, or the conversation that usually entertained me. But it was a futile effort. 
I glanced around at my fellow legionnaires, their faces unchanging from the last couple of battles. The loss of Lucius and Aulus had cast a long shadow, poisoning the once carefree demeanor I used to hold. Contaminating everything I lay my eyes on, dulling every color from a vibrant bright to a dull gray.
I remembered long-ago campaigns, the thrill of discovery, the brotherhood forged around campfires under the star-dusted sky. War had always been a harsh mistress, but there was once a sense of adventure, a youthful naivety that made it bearable. Now, it's all different.
Luicus' laughing, his complaints over the food, and Aulus' annoying habit of leaving his filthy clothing scattered around the tent seemed like distant recollections from a bygone era. Aulus' death had put the last nail in the coffin of the carefree soldier I used to be. Now all I felt was emptiness, which mimicked the awful stillness of his absence.
In my sack, hidden beneath the entrenching tools and cutlery lies two little treasures: Lucius's smooth, weathered identifying stone and Aulus' crudely carved wooden figure. These were all I had left of them, concrete memories of the lives lost to Xaltocan cruelty.
With a silent vow, I clenched my fist around the trinkets. They would find their final resting place amidst the smoldering ashes of Yolotli, a burial that marked the end of their torment and the beginning of Xaltocan reckoning. Every agonizing step forward, every drop of sweat scorching my brow, was fueled by this single, burning purpose. To see Yolotli reduced to dust, a fitting end for the barbarity it embodied, and to lay my friends to rest in the heart of their fallen enemy.
However noble, the road to Yolotli stretched before me, a path paved with uncertainty and danger. But I would walk it, driven not by glory or conquest, but by the searing pain of loss and the unyielding promise of vengeance. The dull gray world might never regain its forgotten vibrancy, but in the ashes of Yolotli, I would find a kind of solace, a tribute to the friends I had lost and I vowed to see this through. For Aulus, for Lucius, for the dream of a civilized world free from the taint of Xaltocan savagery. Only then, would a sliver of peace. Knowing that the souls of Lucius, Aulus and countless others may rest peacefully, knowing that I had witnessed and carried their torches from the dark and into a new age for them in the afterlife, and for rome. And maybe, just maybe, for a chance to rediscover the joy of a simple sunrise, the beauty of an untamed forest, a feeling I feared might be forever lost to me. 
A jolt of electricity shot through me, momentarily shattering the oppressive monotony of the march. In the distance, a plume of smoke rose against the cyan canvas of the sky, a slender finger pointing towards mighty Jupiter himself. 
“Smoke signal! Men! Ahead!” Titus boomed, pointing his gladius upwards, towards the distant smoke curling into the clouds. It was faint, but unmistakable.
Gaius, his keen eyes catching the same telltale sign, barked a sharp order. “Men! We're a bit late today! We might not be the first to Yolotli after all!”
The ranks slowly sparked a low murmur of mostly surprise. The discovery of the other cohorts already at Yolotli, even if the signal appeared old, injected a shot of excitement into me. The other Cohorts, perhaps driven by the same righteous fury, had already begun the process of dismantling the Xaltocan barbarity.
As we picked up the pace, the rhythmic crunch of boots on earth became a thunderous war drum, booming with each synchronized step. The forest floor blurred beneath my feet, the dull gray world that had become my new reality seemed to shimmer with the promise of the light at the end of the tunnel, the sunrise to shine its light on the eternal night, the end to a journey, plagued by loss and grief.
The men pressed on. Excitement and apprehension quickly morphed into determination. No matter what awaited us beyond the walls of Yolotli, we would face it head-on, the heart of this Xaltocan savagery is just beyond the horizon anyways, and whether we were the first or the second wave, one thing was certain, it would fall to our will.
Finally, we emerged from the forest that had been our surroundings for the better part of a week and into a sight that stole the breath from my lungs. Rolling green hills were all that I saw for miles, short, wide mountains rose from the distant horizon ahead, serving as the background to our advance.
And in the middle of nature's beauty, sat a faint, white silver nestled between two giants, not the distant mountains, but of a subtle, bluish haze encompassing the white sliver on both sides. Yolotli. 
“There it is! C'mon! Are we just going to stop here!?” Giaus roared, fueling our walk to this allusive city I had only experienced in name only for the past two weeks or so, but there it is, the source of all savagery, a bastion of barbaric practices.
As we drew closer, the plume of smoke in the distance began to grow and grow before looming over us in a terrifying, yet majestic look. And aside from smoke, in the distance, the sliver of white I had initially perceived grew and grew, slowly morphing into the walls of Yolotli a few hundred paces away from our position, seemingly scarred and cracked from the boulders pounding the walls from nearby catapults, varying from heavy to light, all in a single row to the right side of our vision.
Suddenly, the sight of a native, not Xaltocan, but a native, our ally, catches our eyes, waving his hands in a bid to catch our attention. 
“Friend! Friend! Your brothers are waiting!” the figure shouted, surprising us with his decent knowledge of Latin. The figure then continued to wave his hands before running-off and disappearing below a hill, only to emerge again, this time with an officer by his side.
“Men! Here we are! Yolotli!” Gaius roared, before leading us towards the waiting officer and ally. Curiosity settled in my gut as I honed my ears towards Gaius' and the officer's conversation.
The officer, in the familiar bronze armor of another legion, approached Gaius with a curt nod. An exchange of greetings followed, punctuated by tense explanations and grim expressions. It appeared this other cohort, and three others, the officer said, had reached Yolotli first and laid siege to the city alongside our ally.
But instead of the quick victory I had imagined, the officer spoke of fierce resistance and impenetrable walls. A far cry from the resilient and the unstoppable power of the roman might I'd envisioned throughout my life.
Finally, the introductions concluded and the officer turned to us. “Welcome, brothers. Camp has been established nearby for the third cohort. Follow me. Those of the fourth cohort, follow our ally” as I take a glance at what awaited us, a sigh of relief escaped my throat, it was not the cramped traditional military camp or an empty area of a forest, but a sea of tents, each big enough for an entire contubernium, all placed in neat rows. But, they didn't look like any tents I'd seen before, tall cone-like tents with eight or so sides, all painted gray, and on each side, the image of a figure of some sort is painted on each side of the tent, strange, but it's a tent nonetheless, definitely given by our generous ally.
With weary gratitude, we reshouldered our packs and followed the officer towards our camp. 
“This would be your new home, take a rest, something big is happening tomorrow!” the officer announced, before giving a stern salute to Gaius and pacing-off into his own camp.
The weight of exhaustion pressed down on me, the camp itself was unwalled, but spacious, with tents lined up on rows of ten, repeating for six lines, enough for a cohort. I followed my contubernium to my tent, a similar tent not far from the center.
Tonight, for the first time in days, we would sleep beneath a roof, not beneath the star-peppered night sky. Tomorrow, we would join our fellow legionnaires in our crusade to crush the Xaltocan menace.
“Sweet dreams Marcus, tomorrow would be a busy day” a voice called, it was Titus, calling me from across the row of tents.
“Will do sir, will do” I answered back, i know for certain that tomorrow wouldn't be a busy day, it would also be a fulfilling day. Yolotli is now in my sight, its walls still refusing to crumble, but with our arrival, i seeked to change that. For Lucius, for Aulus, for the countless restless spirits, and for the gods.

Chapter XXVII

The familiar clanging pots and pans roused me awake. As I stretched my stiff muscles and sat up, the chatter of my comrades filled the tents, but unlike the expected dumb jokes or stale rumors, the conversation this morning was about something else entirely, the longing for home.
“Another day in this wasteland,” a man grumbled. “Just how long do they expect us to stay here, grilling those tasteless pods, a dimension away from rome?”
His words were soon followed by murmurs of agreement from the others. The initial excitement that had gripped the men earlier seemed to wane, replaced by a yearning for home.
“All i know is when we're done with all of this,” another grumbled “i'm going back to europe, atleast im not surrounded by these Xaltocans every minute of the day…” the man continued, true to his word, the legionnaire looked unphased by any promises of gold or silver, he looked… disgruntled, like many others.
The familiar routine of life back in the Empire. They were tired, they were homesick, and the endless task of conquering stretched before them like a never-ending nightmare.
I understood them. The thought of a warm meal, a soft bed, and loved ones by your side was a powerful temptation, a stark contrast to the harsh reality unfolding. But for me, the desire to see Yolotli fall was about more than just glory or conquest. It was something else entirely, far grander than myself.
But despite our disparate reasons, a singular purpose bounded us and the whole force together. We were all here for a reason, a reason grander than our personal desires. Whether it's the promise of a warm bed or the burning need for justice, we were united in our resolve to see Yolotli crumble.
The clanging of pots and pans gradually grew silent as the men finished their breakfast followed by the clicking of metals of men wearing their armor, then, a sudden boom rang out from the front of the camp, jolting any half-asleep men awake once and for all.
“Legionnaires!” Gaius roared. “It's time that Yolotli, the festering heart of Xaltocan savagery, crumbles beneath our very feet.”
“In a moment's due,” Gaius continued, his voice low but carrying across the crowd, “we will combine our efforts and storm Yolotli, we are assigned the eastern gate, the gate across this field.”
He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in and vaguely pointing towards Yolotli behind him, pointing towards this 'eastern gate' he was talking about. “Our objective is simple. When the trumpet blares, we will launch a full-frontal assault on that gate. Our numbers are greater now, and we could finally mount an attack on the gate. With a concentrated barrage of boulders and arrows, we will create a breach. Then, and only then, do we charge in.”
The legionnaires grumbled their agreement. The plan was simple, but dangerous. Attacking straight-on was risky, staring death in the face. But the thought of finally breaking through the Xaltocan's defenses, of ending this brutal war, filled them with courage.
“Remember, men!” Gaius roared, his voice filled with fighting spirit. “We're not fighting for fame or fortune, but for the future of everything civilized! These Xaltocan savages threaten everything we hold dear. Today, we crush them with the power of Rome! Our men, they have been bombarding Yolotli for Jupiter knows how long, we wouldn't fail their efforts would we?”
A mighty cheer erupted from the legionnaires, their voices echoing through the flat plains that lay ahead. Gaius raised his hand, quieting the cheers. “Listen close. Once the eastern gate falls, we secure the nearby areas. Hold your ground until the northern gate crumbles too. Only then do we head deeper into the city.”
He scanned the faces of the soldiers. "We are legionnaires, the best fighters the world has ever seen. Today, we prove it again. Today, Yolotli falls!"
Another roar of approval shook the ground. With a determined glint in his eyes, Gaius raised his sword. The men followed suit, a sea of glinting metal reflecting the harsh sunlight. 
Then, a trumpet blared, a call to battle. The wait was over. The attack on Yolotli was about to begin. With one, mighty yell, we let out a roar that shook the ground and charged towards the city. My heart thumped like a drum in my chest, and I paced with my brothers, my sword steady on my hip.
Up on the broken walls, Xaltocan warriors scurried about, then, with one unified movement, the Xaltocans stretched their arms out and pointed at the sky. 
Incoming arrows.
Without needing a single barked command, years of grueling training kicked in. Legionnaires around me slammed their shields together, forming a wall of overlapping bronze, the Testudo formation we'd drilled into our very souls. The rhythmic crunch of sandals on grass slowly was dominated by a dull thud as the shield protected us from our graves overhead. The thudding of arrows becoming more and more pronounced as we slowly lurched forward towards the gate
But against the hail of arrows coming our way, every fiber of my being burned with a white-hot determination, a fire forged in the blazing inferno of grief and vengeance. I wouldn't let them stop me. Yolotli would fall, not just for the glory of Rome, but for Aulus, for Lucius. Their faces, etched in my memory, fueled my every step, a silent oath sworn on their sacrifice.
Then, a bone-jarring tremor ran through the Testudo as I saw from the gaps in the shields, a massive boulder slammed into the gate, followed by another, and another, The thudding of impacts grew steadier, a relentless assault against the wooden gates. Then, with a sudden, deafening crash. The gate had splintered. Our time had come.
A yell erupted from the Xaltocan ranks. They abandoned the crumbling wall, presumably retreating to prepare for the inevitable fight. Without hesitation, the men surged forward, a wave of armored fury crashing through the breached gate.
I dropped the Testudo formation as quickly as it had been formed, adrenaline surging through me. My gladius flashed in the harsh sunlight as I joined the charge, a primal roar escaping my lips. 
Xaltocan warriors materialized from the smoke-filled streets not too long later, their faces contorted in a mix of defiance and terror. Steel met obsidian in a symphony of clangs and screams. 
This was what all those losses, all those pain, all those grief, all those trials are waiting for, a brutal ballet of life and death. Every thrust of my gladius, every parry of a Xaltocan axe, was fueled by the memory of Aulus' banter and Lucius' humor. Today, their sacrifice wouldn't be in vain. Today, Yolotli would bleed.
A tidal wave of Roman steel crashed through the splintered gate, flooding the street with steel and wood. But unlike the scattered resistance I'd braced for, a wall of Xaltocan warriors materialized before us, a line of fierce faces ready to face our lines. The guerilla warfare I'd braced myself for was no more, this will be a head-on clash.
With a sudden, coordinated movement, these Xaltocans threw their spears into the air, launching them at full-speed towards our lines. What do they think they are doing!? Copying our tactics? Very well.
The spears launched towards our lines regardless, a wall of obsidian closing the distance, but unlike the pilums or rome, their spears barely did anything against our shields, most lodging themselves a shallow distance before dangling.
A flicker of amusement made its way to the edge of my rage. These Xaltocans, it seemed, had tried to use our tactics, their desperate attempts to mimic the power of Rome had entertained me for a fleeting moment. But their efforts were as clumsy as a child.
My amusement then curdled back into fury as I spotted a particularly arrogant Xaltocan amongst their ranks, He roared a challenge, his voice cracking with a clearly nervous energy. This fool would be my example.
My heart hammered against my ribs, adrenaline pulsing. Gone was the creeping unease of the alleyways, here, the enemy was clear, a target for justice. And with a roar that ripped through the very air, I launched myself forward. The Xaltocan flinched, his bravado melting into a look of sheer terror. He then fumbled with his axe, managing to strike my left shoulder guard with a mighty blow, the weapon was clearly unfamiliar in his grasp in a foolish attempt to hack me away.
I felt a stinging pain from my left shoulder, but I swept the pain aside, tunneling my vision to the Xaltocan, and with one, great leap, my gladius flashed in a deadly arc as it lunged towards his chest. The Xaltocan let out a strangled gasp before he crumpled to the ground
A tangible gasp rippled through the Xaltocan ranks. Their poorly formed line, an attempt to imitate glorious Rome's line, faltered, confusion replacing their attempt to imitate Roman discipline. It was the opening we needed.
With a thunderous battle cry, I surged forward once more. My comrades, recognizing the opportunity, roared in unison and followed my charge. The Xaltocan line dissolved into chaos. Their copied tactics, a shadow of Roman might, offered no help against our fury.
Steel met flesh in the streets as the Xaltocans fell like wheat before a blade. Every fallen enemy is a step closer to the heart of Yolotli, a step closer to the beating heart of savagery. Today, these Xaltocan mimickers would learn the true meaning of warfare.
But just as the momentum of the battle swung in our favor, the Xaltocan retreat revealed to itself that no, it wasn't a scramble for survival, but a coordinated withdrawal, albeit messy. Most Xaltocan warriors, eyes wild with defiance, launched themselves at the Roman line in a suicidal last stand, a foolish strategy at best.
“They're retreating!” A centurion's voice boomed. Legionnaires around me hesitated, their initial fury morphed into uncertainty. We weren't sure if this was a tactical retreat or a desperate ploy to lure us deeper into a trap. Just then, as we contemplated on our lives or following orders, a thunderous boom erupted from the right, shaking the very ground beneath our feet. The northern gate. It had fallen.
A collective cheer rose from the legionnaires behind me, but their celebration was short-lived though as most of the Xaltocans surged towards the breached north gate. Leaving behind a rearguard, a ragtag group, determined to hold us back.
The battle resumed with a renewed intensity. This time, however, the chaos was tinged with a strange sense of relief. We weren't alone in this brutal dance of war. The thunderous booms erupted again, punctuating the clash of steel. But as I glanced towards the source of the sound, I found what could only be described as a smudge of gray in my vision, followed by a spectacular display, most crashing harmlessly into rooftops or exploding in plumes of dust in the streets, far away from any engagement.
The catapults, they had come to aid us despite their less-than-ideal aim. Their booming presence filled me and our lines with a surge of reassurance. We weren't just a lone army thrusted into this mess. The full might of Rome, even if somewhat clumsy at times, stood beside us. Yolotli would fall, not just through our blades, but under the relentless, if somewhat inaccurate, barrage of stones.
After what felt like an eternity stuck at this stalemate, With a renewed battle cry, I lunged forward, my gladius flashing in the harsh sunlight. The Xaltocan rearguard, though desperate, fought with a ferocity fueled by the knowledge that retreat was not an option. The battle, once glorious, now devolved into a brutal stalemate, a churning mass of bodies struggling for dominance in the heart of this burning city. But somewhere, deep within the chaos, a flicker of hope remained. The northern gate had fallen. We were breaching Yolotli, inch by inch. And vengeance, though perhaps aided by some questionable catapult skills, was slowly within reach.
The clash of steel from the north gate grew louder as the seconds passed, a counterpoint to the desperate struggle around me. The Xaltocans now fought with obvious desperation. Their eyes darting nervously towards our lines, their ranks thinning with each fallen warrior.
A lucky shot from one of our catapults, despite its incompetence, found its mark. A colossal rock slammed into a building behind the Xaltocan lines, sending a plume of dust and debris into the sky. A ripple of panic spread through the enemy ranks, a crack.
Then, abruptly, the booming ceased. The comforting thunder of the catapults, however inaccurate, had fallen silent. Silence descended upon the battlefield. The Xaltocans, sensing the shift, hesitated. Some, fueled by a desperate hope, turned and fled towards the north, only to be met with an unlucky shower of stones, remnants of the last catapult volley finding their mark.
But most remained, trapped between our relentless advance and the unknown threat building at the northern gate. This was about breaking the Xaltocans, driving them out of this district, one bloody step at a time.
A roar erupted from behind us, a guttural battle cry despite the heat of battle, the sudden cry, the sudden cease of catapult support, it all clicked. No need for words, his intent was clear. Forward.
With a renewed battle cry of my own, I charged forward, my gladius flashing in the sunlight. The Xaltocans, their defiance crumbling, met our attack with a mixture of fear and clumsiness, despite our lesson that no, copying doesn't make you immediately good, they pressed on with the mockery of a roman line. Inch by bloody inch, the Xaltocans were quickly wrestled with. And with every fallen enemy, every step forward, vengeance drew a step closer.
After what felt like an eternity in this mess, a mournful horn blared through the streets, the Xaltocans, their defiance finally shattered, dissolved and fled the other way. Most surging towards a nearby bridge, a narrow span crossing a wide, murky canal, their only escape from the slowly advancing Roman forces.
A roar ripped from a centurion's throat, ordering a pursuit. But before I could join the charge, a hail of arrows rained down from the far bank of the canal. The pursuing legionnaires stumbled back, shields raised in a desperate defense. The clatter of arrows against metal filled the air, a chilling reminder of the Xaltocans' cunning tactics. We wouldn't chase them across open ground under a rain of death.
Every fiber of my being screamed to chase those fleeing Xaltocans, to deliver the final blow, to deliver justice served cold. But reason, dulled by the haze of battle and the burning need for vengeance, flickered back to life with all its might, lighting up the flames of logic and thinking in the heat of battle. 
A suicidal charge across the bridge would be foolish.
Just like that, having used my full brain capacity, my legs, heavy with fatigue, propelled me towards a lone, battered bench that sat amidst the carnage. It was untouched by the spray of blood and the char marks that bruised the surrounding buildings, a strange oasis of normalcy in the heart of this burning inferno.
As I collapsed onto the rough wood, my breath came in ragged gasps, my muscles screamed in protest and for the first time in what felt like an eternity, I allowed myself to simply… exist.
Around me, dust finally descended from the sky after being tossed tens of feets into the air, and across the wide canal, the Xaltocans huddled near the bridge, their faces etched with a mixture of despair and defiance. We, the victors, stood on our side, separated by the murky water and a hail of spent arrows. Glares were exchanged, silent promises of renewed conflict, but that's about it, glares. For now, that was all either side could manage.
The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the smoke-filled sky with streaks of orange and purple. The world around us seemed to hold its breath, a tense calm before the inevitable storm. But for now, we had this fragile moment of respite. A chance to mend our wounds, sharpen our blades, and steel ourselves for whatever horrors tomorrow might bring. As darkness descended upon Yolotli, I closed my eyes, the image of the city walls a constant reminder of the fight yet to come. We were battered, but not broken. And tomorrow, we would face the dawn with vengeance in our hearts and the unwavering spirit of Rome at our backs.
As the sun sets on Yolotli, I closed my eyes, exhaustion finally settling on my shoulders after countless times I told it to go away. The adrenaline that had fueled my every move had long evaporated, leaving behind a dull ache in every muscle. But, amidst the fatigue, satisfaction bloomed. We had held our ground and pushed back the Xaltocans across this gaping canal. Yolotli, though scarred and blood-stained, was a little less Xaltocan and a little more Roman today.

Chapter XXVIII

A jarring crash ripped me from the brief sleep I could muster last night. It wasn't the familiar cling clang cling clang of pots and pans, but the unmistakable thunder of boulders slamming against something solid. Yesterday's victory felt like a lifetime ago, replaced by a bone-deep aching that settled in after a night spent dozing under the constant rumble of the catapults.
With a groan, I pushed myself upright. The smell of smoke and dust dominated the air in their unrelenting stench, a lingering reminder of the bombardment that had taken place throughout the night. Stretching my stiff limbs, I winced at the sharp stings of pain that shot through my arms and legs. Every fiber of my being yearned for a proper night's sleep.
But there would be no rest for either side in this war-torn city. The battle for Yolotli would rage on. A quick glance around the camp confirmed my suspicions. Most of my comrades were already burnt out, faces etched with a mixture of exhaustion and reluctancy at another day of sword and shields.
We had pushed back the Xaltocans yesterday, yes, but how far until the souls of my comrades could truly rest? One thing I knew for certain is that this war was far from over.
I reached for the green pods in my sack since today, we would face whatever horrors the Xaltocans had planned again and today, we would push the Xaltocans back again, whatever the cost.
I grabbed a hunk of the signature green pod, my new staple in this new world, or Terra Furana if you will. Strapping on my chestplate and my helmet, I put my hand around the green pod while the other holds my shield aloft, scraping away the golden kernels on my way to Yolotli.
As I paced towards and through the obliterated gates of Yolotli, I joined a throng of legionnaires already shuffling, the boom of the catapults growing louder and louder as we slowly creeped our way towards the giants.
As we neared the gaping canal the Xaltocans fled across, a strange sight greeted me. The wide-open spaces, a perfect ground to move were somewhat deserted. The legionnaires I was shuffling with suddenly scurried to each side of the road we're walking through, opting for the narrow alleyways instead of the nice and wide road ahead, their once-proud formations dissolved into a trickle. 
Why weren't we using the open roads? Why the sudden shift to these cramped, twisting passages? Looking around, I was met with no answer, just the sight of legionnaires twisting and turning through the alleyways.
“Soldier!” a voice called, “Have your centurion told you anything yet!? Alleyways! Not roads!” the voice continued.
Swiveling around, I was greeted by a centurion, it was not Titus or any faces I'd vaguely recognised. But, without any more words, the unnamed centurion grabbed me by my shoulder and dragged me backwards and to the side, face crossed with disbelief and disappointment, only stopping me and lightly shoving me towards a winding path.
“Sir, with all due res—” I blurted, the words barely came out of my mouth before the centurion interrupted me with a barrage of grumbling.
“Soldier! Have you gone mad!? Alleyways! Those Xaltocans would spot us across their canal! What have your centurion told you this morning!?” the man barked, face still crossed with disbelief and disappointment, this time to the extreme.
“Unbelievable… which century do you belong to lad?” he questioned, the sudden switch-up from a steaming pot of anger to a disappointed facepalm gave me the chills.
“Titus Valerius is my centurion sir! Requesting assistance.” I blurted once again, trying my best not to infuriate this unnamed inferno.
With a sigh the rivaled the gods themselves, the man pointed towards my back, “southern flank, make sure to not stumble on any open field, be a rat and hide behind the houses alright?” the man said, without much of anything to say, i gave a curt nod before pacing my way down the narrow alleyway, to this 'southern flank'.
As I navigated the maze of alleyways down south, the dense housing pressed in on all sides, a sensation that somehow felt… familiar. The twisting paths, the high walls blocking out the sun, it was a strange mimic of the poorer districts in Rome itself months ago, a far cry from the grand avenues and roads I yearned for.
Pushing through the maze-like layout of Yolotli, legionnaires started to pop-up from the corners and bends, first it's just one, then two, then three, and in no time, the once-quiet alleyways bursted like a disturbed anthill, I strained to find Titus or any familiar face. But the press of bodies and the low murmur of anxious conversation made it difficult to spot anyone. 
Just as frustration began to take root, a gruff voice cut through the houses. "Marcus! Over here!"
I whipped my head around, scanning the sea of helmets. Relief flooded me as I spotted a familiar plume of feathers, Titus, standing impatiently in a side alley. He signed me over, his face crossed with something else I couldn't quite decipher.
Weaving through the busy and narrow paths, I finally reached his side. “Titus,” I greeted, “What's going on? Why are we using these alleys?”
“Word came down from Gaius,” he explained, his voice low. “Were launching a surprise attack, Gaius wants no man to be seen by the Xaltocans.”
“Where are we headed?” I asked, tightening my grip on my gladius.
“South flank,” Titus replied, his gaze flickering across the alleyway. “Apparently, there's been some movement from the Xaltocans. Gaius suspects they're rigging traps and fortifying the center bridge and its surrounding areas”
“Lead the way, Centurion,” I said, my voice rife with resolve. “We will push those dogs back a canal again.”
Titus gave a curt nod, his lips pressed into a thin line. We plunged deeper into the twisting alleyways. The battle for Yolotli had taken a turn it seems.
Through a series of twists and turns I couldn't even comprehend, the oppressive weight of the buildings pressing down on us finally opened into a narrow street, sunlight blazing down onto the dusty dirt. Two legionnaires stood, leaning against a wall ahead, just outside an intersection to a wider road ahead, their shields propped up against the wall.
“Marcus,” Titus said, his voice low, “you'll wait here with Maximillus and Aemilius. Orders are to wait until the trumpet sounds.” He gestured towards the two waiting legionnaires. “Long order short, if you hear our trumpet blare and they start running, you better follow suit alright.”
With a curt nod, Titus disappeared back into the maze of houses that is Yolotli. I turned to both of the men, their armor dented and scratched, scars from yesterday's battle. They offered me nods of acknowledgment, but their eyes still held a flicker of nervousness.
Across the street, mirroring our position, a line of legionnaires crouched in similar alleyways between houses. Waiting for the same blare of a trumpet. I tried looking further down the street but my view was blocked by a sharp turn. But based on the number of helmets passing by in the alleyways, I could only imagine the entire street was filled with legionnaires.
Then, the sound of a trumpet splits the tension. The legionnaires around me, myself included, surged to our feet, adrenaline coursing through our veins. The waiting was over, the clock had ticked. We were about to unleash the full fury of Rome upon the unsuspecting Xaltocans.
A chorus of war cries followed suit as legionnaires on the other side of the street finally emerged from their spots and into the streets, transforming the once desolate roads into a mighty river of men,steel and shouts. 
Swept-up by the unstoppable currents of soldiers, I was thrusted along for the ride, a ride towards a waterfall of war and destruction. As this river of destruction surged through the houses and roads, I saw, in the distance, across the gaping canal, barely noticeable, the outline of scurrying Xaltocans, fleeing from wherever they were and into our bridge.
Across the other bridge, far in the distance up north, I see the outline, a sliver of red and silver, the outline of the northern flank, the Xaltocans, mere smudges at this distance rushed towards my comrades up north, but our flank? Virtually unstoppable.
About a couple paces before the bridge's end, our forces suddenly slowed, the vanguard was facing resistance it seemed, the Xaltocans and their unrelenting ferocity… it almost amazed me. Progress, once blasting, sprinting as fast as a galloping horse, now slowed to a snail's pace, crawling almost. Once dashing through the bridge, now mere walk.
Eventually, as the vanguard ahead hacked and sliced their way through the Xaltocan ranks, leading us a safe passage across the bridge, we then spilled into the other side of the canal i'd heard many called 'the second district', whatever its name may be, like spilled water on a flat table, we slowly expanded our forces and slowly creeped into the surrounding areas, and as if a switch had been flicked, the legionnaires fought with a renewed fury last seen only yesterday.
Suddenly, a blare of a trumpet, not ours, but Xaltocan, sliced the air, and just like yesterday, the Xaltocans seemed to retreat again. But something was off, the Xaltocans this time retreated not with the same scattered forms yesterday, but in an orderly fashion, they were not done with mimicking romans perhaps?
“Chase them down! I want every Xaltocan out of this city!” a centurion ordered, command ringing through our helmets and just like that, the legionnaires in front lowered their shields, stretched their gladius and lunged forward, cutting through the wide, dusty roads while some bolted down narrow alleyways, the rest of us following suit in their footsteps.
As the vanguard charged head-on, their furious battle cry bounced off the buildings surrounding us, amplifying the already deafening roar. Ahead, a recent plume of smoke descended from the sky, obscuring what lay ahead, a nervous chill ran through me, why had these Xaltocans retreated so easily? Are they cowards, masked in a thick layer of courage? Just as those thoughts descended on me, another thing, leagues in deadliness also descended, bringing with it more chaos and shock.
A mix of black and brown smudges arced through the air ahead, aiming straight for us… arrows, a trap, outwitted and outsmarted by these savages that we swore to destroy, but like everything the sun casts its light on, arrows, much less anything else, will not yield to mortal thoughts.
Clang here, thud there, a scream here and a groan there, caught off guard, the vanguard, once a symbol of roman might and bravery, now lay scattered from the hail of arrows, just as the rain of death ceased, another followed suit, this time with much more fury.
Before I could take a single step, my body was thrusted backwards, as if a great force had blown a wind so mighty, it could send a mountain flying, then, a clang so loud it deafened my ears boomed, followed by searing pain erupting in my chest. 
Gasping, I looked down. There, lodged in my chestplate, was an obsidian arrowhead, its black tip just barely managing to puncture the layers of steel. The world around me dissolved into a mess of chaos, the battle, the colors, the buildings, everything faded into a distant, distorted dream.
Was this it? Would I fall here? in this nameless street, joining Aulus and the countless others whose blood stained the streets far away from home? My thoughts were interrupted by the occasional springs of pain in my chest, a deadly beat that tosses a coin on my soul.
Aulus' and Lucius' faces then flashed in my mind, their laughter warm and familiar, a stark contrast to the cold obsidian digging into my flesh. I couldn't let him down. There was unfinished business here, this wasn't the way I envisioned it, not a whimpering death in a random house. How could I abandon them now, when they needed me most? No. I wouldn't, not now, not ever. 
With a scream that ripped through the pain, I yanked the arrow free. Blood, hot and slick, soaked a patch of my tunic, warming a section of my skin underneath.
The arrow, a cruel souvenir from the Xaltocans, lay discarded on the floor. A reminder of what could have been, something I refused to accept. 
With a surge of renewed determination, I clambered to my feet. Holding a firm, gritting teeth against the pain. I wouldn't let a Xaltocan arrow, a random twist of fate, steal my purpose. Running outside of the unknown house, it felt as if the world outside had shifted. The once fierce battle roaring a couple paces away was now a distant roar with the clasihing of steel against obsidian accompanying the distant rumble.
Had I been unconscious all along? Collapsing on my feet whilst dreaming of reality? Perhaps I'm in the support lines, far away from battle, perhaps a medic had heard my cries… perhaps… no, not now, Yolotli stands strong as i speak.
Ignoring the questions hammering in my skull, I bolted towards the mess ahead. My once-purposeful strides were reduced to pathetic limps, but when does that ever stop my advance? When does that ever stifle progress?. I pressed on, fueled by a silent oath that yes, an arrow had mocked me with its obsidian glare and no, even though we had pushed forward, shifting the tide in our favor, the fight was anything but over.
Slowly, ever so slowly, I limped my way back towards the battlefield, defying my injury with every step of my legs. The roar of Xaltocan and Roman cires mixing together in one symphony of war, a heads-up of what's to come
Joining the reserve lines, from the gaps between helmets ahead, I could barely make out the faces of Xaltocan warriors ahead in their bid to dislodge our lines with an almost animalistic fury instead of their laughable attempt at a roman battle line I faced-off yesterday. Gone was any semblance of controlled aggression, it was now pure pandemonium.
Then, a centurion's voice rose above the deafening roar that dominated the battlefield. “Push them! The northern flanks had already broken their lines!” the centurion paused, his voice seemed to bounce-off the ears of the men in front. “If these dogs get scared when one person slammed their shields, why not all of us!? Surge forward! These savages stood no chance against Roman might!” the centurion roared. Just like that, the legionnaires upfront suddenly slammed into the Xaltocan lines, seemingly routing most from what I could see.
I could only glimpse at the brutal ballet unfolding ahead. Swords flashing like fireflies, shields thudding from the smidge of black and brown of a Xaltocan club of sorts, descending from the skies above.
The Xaltocans, their defenses crumbling, fought with more and more fury from our suddenly stifled advance. Our coordinated surge, a battering ram of steel and fury, was proving stoppable. The tide was turning, and with a final, earth-shattering roar, our forces overwhelmed the remaining Xaltocan resistance. Their lines eventually dissolve back into a panicked rout, fleeing back towards the safety of another canal.
The final clash, a small dance of flashing swords, clashing shields, and screams of the dying had drained the battlefield. Now, a quiet descended on the scene, as sudden as the trumpet's blare that had ignited the chaos.
Dust, kicked up by a thousand boots and clashing blades, slowly settled, revealing a scene ripped from Hades' dream. Bodies, both Xaltocan and Roman, lay across the road, some lay frozen in mid-motion while some lay unceremoniously on the ground.
Through the haze of pain and exhaustion, I pushed forward. I had survived, against all odds. I had played my part, though small, in this creeping advance towards the very heart of savagery.
High above the rooftops of countless houses, countless proud Roman standards peeked through the dense forest of blocks. The eagle emblem, glinting in the sun, was more than just a piece of cloth and metal. We had paid a terrible price, but we had pushed the Xaltocans again. under the crimson-streaked sky, a single standard stood tall. It was a testament that we, the battered and weary survivors, would be there to meet the Xaltocans one more time, once and for all.
Leaning against a marred wall, I let the wave of exhaustion crash over me. Blood, a crimson tide, seeped through the cracks in my armor, my vision twisted, distorting any simple shapes into twisting and bending lines.
Then, I spotted it. In the distance, a familiar shape rose above the rooftops, a Xaltocan monument, however, this one, unlike the previous, smaller one I'd seen a couple days ago, was far grander. This monument, a symbol of their power, a symbol of their strength might as well have stood as their final act of defiance in the face of Rome, and with this, I vowed to see it crumble, to watch its stones fall like leaves off a dead tree, it's not about personal glory, but about the wandering spirits that haunt this land.

Chapter XXIX

A bone-rattling crash rang through the abandoned house, ripping me from a restless sleep. Dust rained down from the cracked ceiling, a snowfall of particles settling all around me. I coughed, and pushed myself up from the makeshift pallet of scavenged rugs and broken furniture.
“Just another day in paradise,” I muttered under my breath, the sounds of battle, a uniform roar punctuated by the occasional scream, were a constant companion these days. Usually, a man would get used to it by now, but the body always finds a way to be exhausted, threatening to pull anyone under.
Thankfully, yesterday, after advancing our lines, Titus finally allowed some of us to sleep inside houses cleared of traps. Not exactly a palace, but a roof over my head and a smooth floor is good enough. A silent thanks went out to the souls who spent hours meticulously checking these places for nasty surprises. But far from the good sleep I'd thought, it came in stolen moments, snatched between patrols and the ever-present threat of a Xaltocan counter-attack. 
Despite the near-constant danger, a strange sense of normalcy had settled inside these houses. Sure, the layout of the houses, the design, the tone is far from european, but it was a house nonetheless, it felt… almost like home.
I chuckled a bit. Home. A word that now carried the weight of loss and a burning desire. Glancing down at the crude bandage wrapped around my chest, a sharp sting punctured my skin, a reminder of the price of that victory.
But dwelling on the past wouldn't win the war. After a sigh, I rose from my makeshift bag and stumbled towards my pack nearby. Another day in Yolotli awaited, another day of scraping for survival amidst the ruins of a city. There would be patrols to run, defenses to shore up, and most likely, more Xaltocan blood to spill. I wasn't sure how much longer this brutal dance could continue, but one thing was certain, I wouldn't falter. Not until Yolotli was truly ours, and the Xaltocan threat vanquished entirely.
Reaching into my pack, I found the last of the green pod sitting amidst the usual clutter of entrenching tools and what not. It wouldn't win any awards at the Colosseum's food stalls, or even in my quaint little town, but right now, it was a feast for an emperor, at least in this war-torn reality. I peeled it open and chowed down the golden kernels. War rations breakfast. Even the victors felt the pinch. Sure, the Roman standard fluttered proudly above the city, a symbol of our triumph. But that didn't fill my stomach. Maybe our ally would throw us more of these green pods but I digress.
Devouring the pod in a heartbeat, I then shouldered my pack and strolled outside, war-torn City awaited. The distant rumble of the catapults and mounted crossbows a constant reminder that the fight for the city was far from over.
A lesson well-learned from the unnamed centurion yesterday, I emerged from the house, opting for the labyrinthine alleyways over the wide avenues just so nobody else screams at my face again. The open streets clearly offered a clear view of anybody that dared to walk down them. How could I be so foolish yesterday? Titus probably got his face yelled at by Gaius, but I digress. Here, in the cramped alley, the sky was barely visible, but at least I wasn't a sitting duck.
As I made my way through the labyrinth of the alleys and onto the bridge. I spotted the occasional glint of gray, pummeling through the air followed by a thunderous boom, and a plume of smoke rising.
Stepping over debris, I navigated the second section of the city, yesterday's work, the roman standard still rising high in the distance. The remnants of yesterday's assault were everywhere. Houses stood in shambles, their walls spilling out onto the streets. Broken carts and shattered furniture scattered the streets and alleyways, if they even exist. The stench of death, a mixture of blood and decay, dominated the air, a grim reminder of the cost, but it was a cost I was willing to pay for a step closer to the embodiment of savagery the lies just across a canal.
Pushing forward, I tried to stick to the narrow alleyways, most blocked by walls of rubble or the occasional tangled mess of wood, it was a true labyrinth, dead end here, a circle there, an endless path here and a massive mountain of rubble there, but i managed to navigate my way through after countless head scratches. Finally emerging, I blinked in the sudden brightness, onto a wider street closer to the heart of the captured section.
That's when I heard it, the unmistakable voice of Titus' debriefing his soldiers. Hurrying towards the sound, I spotted Titus surrounded by legionnaires, and as I approached, he glanced up, a flicker of surprise crossing his features.
“Marcus,” he rumbled, “Just the man I was looking for. You're not late, are you?”
I shook my head, “No, sir. Just… navigating the back alleys.”
Titus snorted. “Wise move yesterday, perhaps. But for today,” he swept his arm across the open street, “we'll be taking a more direct route. The sappers have cleared most of the rubble, the main streets are safe from traps.”
“I.. i thought we're supposed to navigate through the alleyways, a centurion yelled at my face yesterday… Was I lucky not to get my leg chopped off by a trap?” I questioned, seeking clarification from the mixed signals that were bombarding my head.
“The cramped alleyways, while hiding us from Xaltocan scouts, were infested with traps. A dozen guys yesterday got their legs chopped off among other nasty things these savages planted, it seems like the Xaltocans were placing more and more traps the further we close-in.”
“Nevertheless, we have the numbers on our side, no need for a surprise attack like yesterday” Titus continued, "Gaius, had ordered us to rush their lines in a final push, no stealth needed" he boomed again, his voice regaining his usual commanding tone, “stick to the open streets. Stay out of the alleyways, understood?”
“Understood, sir,” I replied, my voice firm. “Good, like i explained to these guys, in a while now, the catapults would hurl dozens of rocks to rain down on the Xaltocans to soften-up their defenses, then, with the usual horn, we form a testudo, make sure you got steady hands because we don't want anybody to suffer on our advance” Titus continued, vaguely pointing to the legionnaires behind him.
The distant booms that had been the background noise for the better part of two days and two nights, suddenly morphed into a ripple-like thuds, the sound akin to tossing a heap of gravel onto a lake. The Roman catapults, it seems, had begun their work, unleashing a rain of stones across the canal, a sign for us to ready-up.
Titus's gruff voice then boomed. “Form up, men!” he roared. “We move out on my words!”
Legionnaires around me, myself included, snapped to attention, adjusting our helmets and snapping into formation.
Following Titus's lead, we marched towards a nearby bridge, where another four centuries were already assembled. A glance across the bridge revealed an assuring sight. Far in the distance, plumes of smoke rose into the clear blue sky from the catapult's initial bombardment of boulders, now, countless smaller streaks of dust erupted throughout the rooftops of the distant houses, the work of dozens of stones raining down from our machines.
Just then, a piercing blast shattered the tense silence. “Testudo!” Titus roared, his voice for a testudo mixing with the other centurion's roar for a testudo.
Shields were raised, forming a nearly impenetrable cube of overlapping shields. We huddled tightly together, seeking protection from the storm of death that's about to descend. This was it. The final push.
The rhythmic crunch of sandals on the earth served as the new background noise to our march. We advanced forward in a slow formation, a living, armored beast inching towards the Xaltocan lines. Our vision was limited by the gaps in the helmets ahead, glimpses of the outside filtering through.
Suddenly, a relentless thudding defended my ears inside the dark and cramped testudo, resonating through the shields above us. The Xaltocan tactic was predictable by now, they dart out from houses, unleash a volley of arrows, and retreat back just before the Roman catapults unleashed their hail of stones.
From the mere glimpses between the tiny cracks in the testudo, I caught a plume of dust and debris erupting in the distance, momentarily obscuring the Xaltocan for a fleeting moment.
But the reprieve was short-lived. As the dust settled, we could hear the guttural war cries of the Xaltocans rising above the dust. We were close now, terrifyingly close. The Xaltocan lines loomed ahead, my grip tightened on my gladius, the leather hilt slick with sweat. 
But Xaltocan warriors wasn't the only thing I could make-out from my cluttered view of the outside world. In the distance, the grand monument, the embodiment of Xaltocan savagery, lay untouched by our catapults, a job well done in case it's a temple of some sort. Scattered throughout this section of the city, smaller versions of the monument dotted the landscape, shrines, perhaps, temples dedicated to their savage gods. Or perhaps those are palaces of the aristocrats, palaces of the wealthy, in that case, i'll see it burn down.
The relentless march continued, and as we neared the end of the bridge, We were slowly nearing the Xaltocan lines now, the press of bodies around me almost suffocating. Through the gaps in the testudo, I could see the Xaltocans mass into a line, ready to mimic our discipline one more time.
With a final, collective roar, the testudo formation dissolved. Shields were lowered, revealing a sea of shining helmets. a thousand warriors poised for the kill.
For a moment, my eyes settled on the central monument one last time, awe, bordering on respect pierced through my rage. but Aulus' face, forever frozen with pain and surprise in his final moments, flashed before my eyes, crumbling any lingering awe. This wasn't a battle against a culture or deities; it was a fight against the men who had taken my friend, who had brought war and devastation to us. 
The booming war cry of a nearby centurion ripped the air, and with another roar, we surged forward, I too lashed out my battle roar and lunged along with my comrades, propelled by a mix of grief, fury, and a burning desire for vengeance. 
Every clash of steel, every parry, every choked scream of a fallen warrior was a tiny act of retribution. Today, I wouldn't be swayed by religious fervor or the urge to desecrate their idols. Today, the only gods I acknowledged were Mars and Hercules, and my offering would be a crimson tide of Xaltocan blood and the charred rubble of houses.
As my comrades upfront met the Xaltocan warriors head-on, the sheer number of our men slowly grew apparent, our numbers, it seemed to overwhelm the Xaltocans. Our synchronized formations, a product of relentless drills, slowly pushed the Xaltocan mass back. One step at a time. Titus wasn't lying.
Through the gaps of my comrades' helmets, I could barely manage a glimpse of the Xaltocan warriors ahead, their faces seemed to be dotted with the same orange-ish dots like stars in the night sky, and through the movements of the vanguard's shield, they also seemed to fight with sluggish energy, doing little to stifle the men in front. Their once-feared obsidian clubs now seemed to swing with lazy energy, clattering harmlessly on the wall of crimson shields ahead. Perhaps Mars himself, the god of war, was smiling upon us, weakening our enemies. Or maybe it was Hercules, the embodiment of strength, lending our men power with each swing of the gladius. Today, on this battlefield, the Roman eagle would soar.
The Xaltocan line, riddled with the curse of Mars and overwhelming Roman numbers, buckled under our relentless pressure. The warriors the vanguard struck down crumbled with a disturbing ease. But just as the Xaltocan line seemed on the verge of collapse, a piercing blare of a horn ripped through the chaos. The Xaltocans, with a desperate surge of adrenaline, turned and limped towards the central monument, the very heart of their city. Hot on our heels, we sliced down any who couldn't muster enough strength to run.
Reaching the monument, the Xaltocan retreat wasn't as smooth as I initially thought. A roar then ripped from within the structure, followed by a surge of the very same warriors and a couple more. A vicious brawl erupted just a hundred paces or so from the monument, a chaotic tangle of limbs and steel filling the once quiet scenery. 
Just as I was absorbing the chaotic scene, an obsidian club whistled through the air, striking the top-half of my shield. A Xaltocan warrior in a fury I've never seen before from these people, had made a narrow call to a direct hit to the head. We parried, we lunged, we swung, sweat stinging my eyes as all around me, a chaotic tornado of bodies collapsed at seemingly random points. With a final roar, I managed to disarm him, my gladius finding its mark with a thud.
Pushing past the fallen warrior, I joined the assault on the monument's makeshift defenses. Fueled by the momentum of the battle, legionnaires slammed against the barricades with all their might. Finally, with a wooden groan, the barricade gave way, surprisingly flimsy despite the Xaltocan's grand achievement right behind them.
A surge of soldiers then poured through the breach, a tide of crimson. Just when I thought we were gaining the upper hand, a hail of arrows rained down from above. Xaltocans, standing on top of the monument itself, unleashed a deadly volley, and Legionnaires too busy in their duty fell around me like wheat before a blade.
“Fall back! Shields up! Let these dogs waste their precious arrows before we unleash hell!” a voice bellowed, the voice barely overpowering the relentless thudding of arrows on my shield, “As soon as the hail of death ceased, rush the monument, their dwindling numbers stood no chance!” the voice continued. Yes sir, yes we will.
The hail of arrows suddenly ceased as fast as it had begun, the Xaltocans, their arrows spent, roared in frustration, a sound that spoke of desperation and dwindling options.
This was it. The moment we'd fought so hard to reach. Days of grueling siege, the sting of Aulus's death, the grief of Lucius' death, the fear, the efforts, the injuries, it all led to this. This final push would crush the Xaltocans, not just the warriors, but Yolotli, turning the tide of battle for good.
With a shared battle cry that rang through the ruined city, we surged forward. The remaining Xaltocans emerged from the monument. Their numbers were depleted, their weapons dulled, but their eyes burned with defiance.
I locked eyes with my opponent, a Xaltocan warrior slightly older than myself, in his gaze, I saw not just hatred, but a flicker of something else, a weary acceptance of his fate. And that's how it should be, to deliver back, to taste their own medicine, to accept that every cause has an effect.
Vengeance finally found its release. Each thrust, each parry, fueled a righteous fury that propelled me forward. But it was more than just vengeance. It was a sense of fulfillment, of finally delivering justice for the fallen, for Yolotli, for the very fabric of Roman civilization.
Slowly, the tide of the battle began to turn. The Xaltocans, weakened by disease and overwhelmed by our numbers, faltered. Their once-fierce attacks became desperate flailing, their battle cries replaced by choked gasps. One by one, they fell, their bodies littering the ground around the monument.
Slowly, the fight around me slowed as my comrades cleared out every and any Xaltocan dogs who dared breathe their unworthy air. A commotion drew my attention. Gaius, helmet off, climbed towards the peak of the monument, one step at a time. With surprising agility for a man of his stature. Reaching the highest point, Gaius raised five crimson Roman standards, each emblazoned with the insignia of our cohorts. A collective cheer then erupted from our ranks, a wave of sound that seemed to rattle the very foundation of the ruined city. We were done. Yolotli had fallen.
I stood with my celebrating comrades, the cheers washing over me like a cold wave. Aulus, Luicus, the countless wandering souls could rest now… or so I thought. Yolotli had fallen, the roman standard was hoisted, the Xaltocans were routed, and… that's it. Yolotli had fallen.
This wasn't the victory I'd envisioned. The vengeance I'd craved kept lingering despite the scene unfolding right in front of my eyes, a phantom just out of reach.
The celebrations continued around me, all I could see were the bodies, Roman and Xaltocan alike, littering the ground. We had won, in a way. But the victory tasted like ash in my mouth. The serpent of vengeance had uncoiled, leaving behind a hollow emptiness that rang in the desolate silence where a triumphant yell should have been.

Chapter XXX

Gaius clambered down from the monument. He then adjusted his breastplate before the afternoon light glinted off the polished metal. With a voice booming with self-assured confidence, he addressed the assembled legionnaires.
“Soldiers! You have fought with the courage of lions! You have fought with the ferocity of wolves! And you have fought with the strength of bears! The city of Yolotli now stands under the proud banner of Rome! Your courage , your ferocity , your strength, these are the qualities that make you the finest legionaries in the empire!”
A cheer then erupted from the ranks. Helmets were tossed in the air, shields clanged together and fists were punching the air. Gaius beamed, his chest puffed out with pride. This was his moment, his victory to claim.
“Tonight,” he continued, “we celebrate! Spoils of war will be distributed amongst you all. Those who wish to rest can return to camp. But know this, your victory here shall be etched in the scrolls of Roman history! Your name will not be forgotten and will continue to be uttered the likes of Agustus and Caesar!”
More cheers followed, interrupted by the thudding of men slapped each other on the back, their faces flushed with a mixture of relief and empowerment. Yet, amidst the cheers erupting all around me, I remained a solitary island of quiet. Gaius' words felt hollow and empty, devoid of any emotion. The spoils of war held no temptation, the promise of rest held no temptation. The absence of any purpose to fight, to stare death at its face, to push through now replaced by a hollow void filled to the brim with emptiness and more emptiness that no amount of cheering or celebration could fill.
My legs moved by their own, each step heavy as I lumbered back towards the camp. The cheers of my comrades soon slowly started to fade, before completely morphing into a mere muffled noise behind me. Now, a growing silence starts to dominate the air, a silence that in a way… felt deafening. I looked around, truly seeing the scene for the first time, truly opening my eyes for the first time, ever. 
The battlefield stretched before me, bodies, both Roman and Xaltocan, lay dotted across the ground, their lifeless eyes staring into the distance. Dust still curled from the ruins of houses, victims of the relentless catapults. Crimson stains occasionally marked the walls and doors of the buildings surrounding me. Crossing the bridge, i looked down at the still water, instead of finding the clear blue sky with my reflection staring back, the sky through the eyes of the still water reflected a crimson red, and instead of my face looking back, lifeless faces, Xaltocans and Roman, stared back, forever frozen in their last emotion before departing from this realm.
How had I not noticed this before? Caught up in the heat of battle, the images of Aulus and Lucius had fueled the whirlwind of fury and focus. Now, with the fight over and the emptiness settling in, I saw everything. 
Where was the soldier I used to be? The man consumed by vengeance, fueled by righteous anger? All I felt now was a nothing, a bottomless pit where purpose and passion once resided. The fall of Yolotli felt like a hollow achievement, the image of a victory built on top of a mountain of corpses. Aulus's face, forever frozen in pain and surprise, flashed before my eyes once more. Was this truly his justice? Was this the peace he sought by leaving this mortal coil?
My legs, devoid of their purpose, carried me without stopping. The camp stood a couple hundred paces' away, dead ahead. The entire length of Yolotli blurred past me, lost in my own pit. I didn't quite register the curious stares of a few weary soldiers returning from patrols, I only sensed heads turning and that's about it. I simply walked..
When my legs finally refused to carry me any further, I simply stopped. In the distance, a rise in the terrain offered a simple escape. Without conscious thought, I began to climb the gentle slope, the tall grass crunching under my boots. The sparse forest that clung to the hillside offered a small refuge, a place to disappear from the storm of emotions swirling within.
A particularly large tree stood at the crest of the hill, its branches reaching wide on all sides. Drawn by an unseen force, I stumbled towards it, collapsing onto the rough earth at its thick roots. The ancient tree seemed to emanate a sense of quiet wisdom, a wisdom learned through fire, wind and water, through the dark and cold nights and through the harsh sun, a silent wisdom forged through a thousand years on this quaint hill. 
The weight of my gladius and shield ached my back. My gaze then drifted downwards towards the city sprawled beneath me. The city, once grand and imposing, now wails in defeat, a canvas of flickering orange, one by one, flames licked at the broken remains of houses and dark plumes of smoke following suit, rising towards the heaven above, a testament to my achievement, our achievement, we made an impact and this is out trophy. This… is our trophy, a million golden trophies yet I felt none, a million phrases and cheers yet none, a grand and noble conquest yet none. Just an empty void ready to be filled with another pile of purpose, only to disappear once more.
Was it worth it? Had the fall of Yolotli truly been a victory? The cheers of my comrades are now nonexistent, replaced by a gentle breeze from the distant mountains and through the rattling leaves. Aulus, Lucius, once a beacon of purpose, now vanished within a heartbeat, once a guiding light, lighting up the path ahead and fueling my body to move, now vanished along with the Xaltocans.
Would they have wanted this? Would they want their friend, their brother, their comrade, to descend into this hollow rage? Would they want their legacy to be etched in the broken ruins of Yolotli?
The celebrations continued in the distance, a grotesque counterpoint to the scene of destruction unfolding before me. The weight of their absence pressed down on me, a physical manifestation of the emptiness now settling in my core. The promise of spoils, the promise of rest, all stood useless and meaningless. All I craved was a return to the man I once was, the man Aulus and Luicus knew. But that man was forever changed by anger and a thirst for vengeance they might not ever want. 
Leaning my head against the bark of this ancient tree, my mind felt leagues heavier. What had I become? A hollow shell consumed by a vengeance that returned emptiness? Had Aulus's death been in vain? Was this the legacy he wants to leave behind? a friend consumed by a rage that twisted his purpose? Luicus, would he look down on me with pity or disgust? Would he even recognize the man I'd become?
A cold wind rustled the leaves, carrying with it the cold breeze mother nature had brought. This soldier, hardened and hollowed out by war, a stranger to the man they knew. 
In the desolate silence beneath the ancient oak, the true weight of my loss, Aulus, Luicus, the man I once was, crashed down on me, leaving me gasping for breath under the crushing burden of a nothing victory.

Chapter XXXI

Cling clang cling clang, it was a sound that I would hopefully learn to deal with for the very last time, but duty calls, to exterminate the Xal… yea… muscle memory.
Before i could embarrass myself infront of my tentmates, the remnants of sleep just managed to hold me back from uttering a single word, regardless, pulling myself up with a groan and digging through my sack to find a single brick of hardtack left, i cracked it in half and threw the other back into the sack, saving it for later, it was risky since i could be fighting Jupiter knows who, but its better than starving tomorrow.
Sitting inside our tents, the outside air felt strangely calm, although yes, the Xaltocans are no more, shoulden't the leigonnaries find another way to spark a fiery debate one way or the other? Were these men so hell-bent on the Xaltocan's destruction, they diden't talk about anything else? Were they going through my same situation? Losing close friends and descending into a madman? 
Turning to my tentmates, instead of the talks of 'home' or 'cottage' a more… a peculiar conversation unfolded.
“Yea! As if they have NO respect whatsoever!” a leigonnary boomed, breaking the calmness that had settled.
“Titus is the one to blame! How could he—” another followed, voice rife with exhaustion and heavy disappointment. 
Titus!? What did he do? Yell at you? He only does that when somebody does something spectacularly stupid, even then, it's a coin toss between brutal insults and outright yelling… 
“Ever heard of necessary evil? Replace 'evil' with oversight and that's your answer bud” a leigonnare interrupted.
“A little issue is fine but a glaring red flag!? That's outrageous!” the soldier retorted, by now this back-and-forth of this unknown issue had distracted me from my hardtack sanding my teeth down for long enough, i'm practically done.
“Ey! You guys have been in there long enough, get your feet outside, time to pack up!” a leigonnare shouted, it was another of my tentmate, an early bird who disappears at the crack of dawn, does a list of unknown things before materrialising, usually silent all the way, but this sudden change in tone to make such a man switch… it must be urgent
The tent, and probably the camp suddenly buzzed with activity, probably going back to camp but Gaius truly knows, we are going to Yolotli number two for all I know, but I digress.
Stepping out of the tent, I see my century, and my whole cohort starting to form into a single marching formation off a couple dozen paces away from where I stood, and here, I saw Gaius, and another officer, chatting as usual, most likely tossing souls like coins again.
Lifting my pack and my sack, I paced towards my assembling century, leaving behind the strange tents our ally had provided. Inching closer to my spot in the formation, instead of the air of relief of home we're probably going, the air was thick with angry sighs and sputtering curses directed at… our… no, not possible.
Looking around for anyone not foaming in the mouth with hatred, I scanned my fellow leigonnaries for any sign of a conscious man, but none was to be found. Only the sea of furrowed brows and more angry faces filled the scene.
“What on earth is happening right now?” I muttered to myself, this time a bit louder to hopefully catch some ears but… everybody seemed to be furious at… something else surely, if not then battle fatigue got the better of them or they did something to anger Mars. whatever it may be, divine curse or fatigue, nothing like that would ever happen after all we had done for them…
“Soldiers! March! Back to camp, we're pushing back reistributing your rightful rewards back at camp!” Gaius suddenly boomed, “we're facing a traitorous issue im sure the rumors had spread the news” he continued, voice unapologetic, almost as if he's also furious.
The leigonnaries around me rose in a significantly quieter roar of understanding and surprising hatred, not towards Gaius as I'd expected, who had pushed their rewards back into our main camp. That would be infuriating for past me, but that's not the case here, not at all. But with Gaius.
As the footsteps of the men began to synchronise and conglomerate into one lump of steadyness, the occasional mutterings and cursing had made itself clearer and clearer, eventually culminating into a particularly loud conversation behind me.
“Once over the blazing city, now scattered on the floor” a soldier muttered.
“Can't agree more, i thought those were their equivalent, turns out to be anything but their identifying banners” another answered, “they give us food and aid in return for toppeling the Xaltocans, then proceeds to backstab us!” the man continued, stomping the ground to match his current mood. I dont need to look back to know that somebody's foaming at the mouth with pure anger.
“Exactly! But now that a new batch of troops will swap our places, these backstabbing rats will learn another lesson from mighty Rome itself!” the other man exclaimed, likely shaking his fists.
As the guys behind me continued their talk, the distant murmurs off a centurion caught my attention, followed by Gaius's occasional voice. Then it abruptly stopped, followed by a faster pacing of steps. Looking back, in the corner of my eye, I could see Gaius, flaked by his usual high-officers on his sides, hovering around Gaius like they always do.
“Sir! Sir! Sir!” I called, hoping Gaius, or even the officers to notice, but to them, especially Gaius, I was just a peculiarly familiar face among the thousands of others they probably shift through everyday.
Annoyed and frustrated, i let them pass by without so much of a sigh, then, as they stopped-by Titus and began talking with him, i was curious on what i could pick-up, but from where i stand, a handful of bodies behind them, i could only pick-up two coherent phrases that crossed this vast gap, being “troop rotation” and “unlawful traitor”.
Again!? Another war in this unknown land!? Rome was starving back home! A war across the vast infinite would be unwise to say the least!
“Told you, we're not fighting twice,” a leigonnary infornt mumbled to his neighbor.
“Fine you're right, good job, atleast i'll sleep well knowing i'm somewhere in Europe, not in this hell of a place” his neighbor retorted, voice laden with a defeated confession and slight disbelief.
“Then, after those guys we're rotating with, finished their campaign here Gaius might call—”
“Please dont finish your sentence, it will only bring stress!” his neighbor retorted, cutting him off mid-sentence.
“It's logical! Another batch of clueless men or experienced veterans?” the man continued, though, i understood both the reason why his poor neighbor had enough of this man while the man only speaks reason, but i digress. Seems like a whole new world will unfold in just a week's worth of sailing.

Chapter XXXII

Years had bled into one another since the dust settled on Yolotli's ravaged streets. The scars still lingered in my mind despite the years that had passed, but the raw ache of loss had softened with time. Here, in the quiet solitude of my study, a different battle raged, one fought with ink and quill. 
Lucius, Aulus and the countless men that left this realm, where does that bring us? A brutal story etched deep within my memory. A story I vowed to tell, not in the crumbling ruins of a city or the annals of history itself, but in the quaint little pages of a book. Yolotli may have fallen, its grand walls and structures reduced to shattered ruins of a bygone era, but the memory of those who fought, who bled, who passed… deserves a more permanent monument.
For Lucius and Aulus, a cold stone monument in the heart of a conquered city would never suffice. They deserve to have their spirits live-on, to have their spirits outlive any marble monument, to outlive any ruins of a city, to outlive Rome itself.
In these pages, their soul will forever echo, a beacon for those who follow. No longer will their sacrifice be a footnote to any grand narrative of conquest. Here, within the pages, they live on, their stories woven into the page itself. 
And so, dear reader, I return to my task, eager to finally turn the last page on this tale. A tale of many stories, a tale of many lessons, and just as you, dear reader, whomever it may be, glossed over the last of words, may the spirits of Lucius and Aulus live just one day longer, and just as you, dear reader, glossed over the last of words, may your eyes rest from its journey across the word-filled sky, finally setting on the distant horizon, just like a sunset west.

Afterword

One of my goals for this project was to create a novella of 20k-30k words. Initially, I'd opted for an alternate-history when the Romans 'discovered' the new world with the main objective being to highlight the reaction of clueless romans describing alien flora and fauna, i was inspired by 'Running out of time' by Margaret Peterson, a story where a girl from centuries ago describe the modern world, i attempted to do the same with Romans and American wildlife
